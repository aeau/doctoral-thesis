Feature                                 & Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\cline{1-2}
Design patterns                   & Their visualization and accuracy should be improved. Other than acting as visual guide for map information, they should be used to help generate rooms as well. They should also be available for the entire dungeon.                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\cline{1-2}
Parameters                                  & They need to have more information about the specific room, and have better visualization in order to make the designer trust their accuracy more. The parameters should also consider the entire dungeon as a whole in different terms such as difficulty and balance.
\\\cline{1-2}
Generated suggestions               & In general, the participants want more variety and control in the generation of suggestions using different types of parameters e.g. their degree of similarity and fitness functions.                                                       \\\cline{1-2}
Redefined feasibility                           & Eddy 3.0’s definition of feasibility should be revised which considers the whole dungeon and its connected rooms.                                                                                                      \\\cline{1-2}
World View                      & The World View should be revised and enhanced with more special features which would encourage users to visit it more.                                                    \\\cline{1-2}
World grid                                       & The computation of the whole dungeon should be improved. It should have an option to define a starting point. Its definition of entrance doors should be improved, as well as the calculation of distances of tile types.                                                                                                                                                                       \\\cline{1-2}
Version control & Some participants want to preview suggestions within the Room View to help their judgment and the ability to save suggestions for later use. They also want to revert to old designs in case they have second thoughts.                                                                                                     \\\cline{1-2}
Templates                             & Some participants want the ability to save their own manual designs to be carried over to other grids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\cline{1-2}
Automated assistance                                  & The participants in general welcome a bit more automated assistance when doing manual designs, which can reduce clicking around the program. It should also not be too invasive for the designer.
