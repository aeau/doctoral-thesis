	abstract = {MAP-Elites has been successfully applied to the generation of game content and robot behaviors. However, its behavior and performance when interacted with in co-creative systems is underexplored. This paper analyzes the implications of synthetic interaction for the stability and adaptability of MAP-Elites in such scenarios. We use pre-recorded human-made level design sessions with the Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites (IC MAP-Elites). To analyze the effect of each edition step in the search space over time using different feature dimensions, we introduce Temporal Expressive Range Analysis (TERA). With TERAs, MAP-Elites is assessed in terms of its adaptability and stability to generate diverse and high-performing individuals. Our results show that interactivity, in the form of design edits and MAP-Elites adapting towards them, directs the search process to previously unexplored areas of the fitness landscape and points towards how this could improve and enrich the co-creative process with quality-diverse individuals.},

In order to investigate the usability of GPT-2 for text generation for video games, we fine-tuned GPT-2 on a corpus of video game quests and used this model to generate dialogue lines for quest-giver NPCs in a role-playing game. We show that the model learned the structure of quests and NPC dialogue, and investigate how the temperature parameter influences the language quality and creativity of the output artifacts. We evaluated our approach with a crowdsource experiment in which human judges were asked to rate hand-written and generated quest texts on language quality, coherence and creativity.},

Increasingly narratives are dynamically adapted for presentation to enhance personalisation or fit different presentational objectives. Narrative generation systems seek to either automatically generate stories from scratch or, create stories from predefined conditions. With the rise of machines as co-authors it is important to consider what the affect is upon the cohesion of the narratives represented or created in this way. Typically, in existing work, this is limited to an analysis of the use of textual language within the narrative to communicate a coherent message. However we find that beyond linguistic connections narrative elements are coherently bound together through other concepts and structures such as themes, genre, narrator, and style. We present these variables, and features that may be used to identify their presence, as an alternative approach to measuring narrative cohesion and demonstrate their application on two generated narratives.}

We focus on how they estimate the interestingness of concepts and conjectures and extract some common notions about interestingness in automated mathematical discovery. We detail how empirical evidence is used to give plausibility to conjectures, and the different ways in which a result can be thought of as novel. We also look at the ways in which the programs assess how surprising and complex a conjecture statement is, and the different ways in which the applicability of a concept or conjecture is used. Finally, we note how a user can set tasks for the program to achieve and how this affects the calculation of interestingness. We conclude with some hints on the use of interestingness measures for future developers of discovery programs in mathematics.",

In the field of Interactive Digital Storytelling (IDS), integrating knowledge about dramatic situations is of great relevance in order to design improved systems that dynamically generate more narratively-relevant events. However, current approaches to dramatic situations are descriptive and not directly applicable to the field of IDS. We introduce a computational model that fills that gap by both describing dramatic situations visually and providing a quantitative measure for the interestingness of a plot. Using a corpus of 20 Aesop's fables, we compared the calculations resulting of the model with the assessments provided by 101 participants. Results suggest that our model works appropriately at least for stories characterized by a strong plot structure rather than their semantic content.",

The engine is tested on its ability to create quests, which are sets of actions that must be performed in order to achieve a certain goal. The engine takes in a world description represented as a set of facts, including characters, locations, and items, and generates quests according to the state of the world and the preferences of the characters in it. We evaluate quests through the classification of the motivations behind the quests. We also compare world descriptions of two different sizes. Compared to human structural quest classification, the current engine was found to be able to replicate the quest structures found in commercial video game quests.}

To address this problem, we present a hybrid approach that combines AI planning and evolutionary optimization in order to generated new plan operators representing possible story actions, within the framework of a planning-based interactive narrative system. We focus our work on inventing plan operators that are useful for contributing to suspenseful interactive stories, using suspense metrics that have been proposed in the literature. We devise an encoding scheme for converting a plan operator into a genetic-algorithm chromosome and vice versa, respecting constraints that are needed for an operator to be well-formed. We discuss the performance of the system, and several examples from preliminary experiments carried out to evaluate the evolved operators.},

abstract={The authoring of fictional stories is considered a creative process. The purpose of most story authoring is not to invent a new style or genre of story that will be accepted by the population but to invent a single narrative that is novel enough to be tellable. Computational story generation systems are more limited than human authors in the space of narratives that can be considered because it is often the case that story generation systems are constrained to operate within a fixed representation of the story world. These limitations can impact whether a story generation system is considered creative or not. In this paper, we describe a story planning system, Fabulist. Fabulist however is constrained by the world model input by the system user. We present two algorithms that enable story planning systems such as Fabulist to break outside the bounds of the initial world model in order to search a larger space of narratives.},

abstract="The ability to generate narrative is of importance to computer systems that wish to use story effectively for entertainment, training, or education. One of the focuses of intelligent virtual agent research in general and story generation research in particular is how to make agents/characters more lifelike and compelling. However, one question that invariably comes up is: Is the generated story good? An easier question to tackle is whether a reader/viewer of a generated story perceives certain essential attributes such as causal coherence and character believability. Character believability is the perception that story world characters are acting according to their own beliefs, desires, and intentions. We present a novel procedure for objectively evaluating stories generated for multiple agents/characters with regard to character intentionality -- an important aspect of character believability. The process transforms generated stories into a standardized model of story comprehension and then indirectly compares that representation to reader/viewer mental perceptions about the story. The procedure is illustrated by evaluating a narrative planning system, Fabulist.",

abstract = {Computer role-playing games (CRPGs) are known for their strong narrative structure. Over time, quests have become one of the main mechanics for leading a player through the story. Quests are given to the player in the form of a set of tasks to complete with few, if any, options. The options given to the player instead often revolve around combat-oriented actions -- requiring the player to engage in combat to progress through the storyline, despite player preference or game story that hints otherwise. We address this issue with the GrailGM, a run-time game master which offers quests and actions to the player based on their history and current world state.},

publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},
address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {Quests are a core element in many games, especially \emph{role-playing} and \emph{adventure} games, where quests drive the gameplay and story, engage the player in the game’s narrative, and in most cases, act as a bridge between different game elements. The automatic generation of quests and objectives is an interesting challenge since this can extend the lifetime of games such as in \emph{Skyrim}, or can help create unique experiences such as in \emph{AI Dungeon}. This work presents Questgram [Qg], a mixed-initiative prototype tool for creating quests using grammars combined in a mixed-initiative level design tool. We evaluated our tool quantitatively by assessing the generated quests and qualitatively through a small user study. Human designers evaluated the system by creating quests \emph{manually}, \emph{automatically}, and through \emph{mixed-initiative}. Our results show the QuestGram's potential, which creates diverse, valid, and interesting quests using quest patterns. Likewise, it helps engage designers in the quest design process, fosters their creativity by inspiring them, and enhance the level generation facet of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer with steps towards intertwining both level and quest design.},

However, despite continued interest in emergent narrative approaches, there has been relatively little work in the area of story sifting to date, leaving it unclear how a story sifting system might best be implemented and what challenges are likely to be encountered in the course of implementing such a system. In this paper, we present Felt, a simple query language-based story sifter and rules-based simulation engine that aims to serve as a first step toward answering these questions. We describe Felt's architecture, discuss several design case studies of interactive emergent narrative experiences that make use of Felt, reflect on what we have learned from working with Felt so far, and suggest directions for future work in the story sifting domain.",

In each event, a piece of information (for example, a game challenge) is presented to the player, and the player responds to that information by executing proper in-game actions. Since different games have different systems and mechanics, it is difficult to analyze and compare game events across different games. In this paper, we propose an approach to measure the similarity between game events from different games quantitatively. This similarity information can then be used to transfer probabilistic models built for analyzing and generating game levels for one game to another game.},

These maps are generally made by hand-assembling manually-created screen-shots of game levels. Besides being tedious and error-prone, this approach requires additional effort for each new game and level to be mapped. The results can still be hard for humans or computational systems to make use of, privileging visual appearance over semantic information. We describe a software system, Mappy, that produces a good approximation of a linked map of rooms given a Nintendo Entertainment System game program and a sequence of button inputs exploring its world. In addition to visual maps, Mappy outputs grids of tiles (and how they change over time), positions of non-tile objects, clusters of similar rooms that might in fact be the same room, and a set of links between these rooms. We believe this is a necessary step towards developing larger corpora of high-quality semantically-annotated maps for PCG via machine learning and other applications.},

We combine these ideas in a prototype visual search engine and compare it with commercial visual search engines. Searching within a corpus of moments from Super Nintendo Entertainment System games using query images extracted from YouTube videos, our prototype is able to identify moments that web-oriented search engines rarely see.},

By modelling the rules of a narrative using norms, we can govern the actions of agents that act out the characters in a story. Agents are given sets of permitted actions and obligations to fulfil based on their and the story's current situation. However, a way to describe stories in terms of social norms is needed. Existing formalisms for narrative do not work at multiple layers of abstraction, and do not provide a rich enough vocabulary for describing stories. We use story tropes as a means of building reusable story components with which we describe the social norms that govern our storyworld agents.",

abstract={Procedural content generation in video games has a long history. Existing procedural content generation methods, such as search-based, solver-based, rule-based and grammar-based methods have been applied to various content types such as levels, maps, character models, and textures. A research field centered on content generation in games has existed for more than a decade. More recently, deep learning has powered a remarkable range of inventions in content production, which are applicable to games. While some cutting-edge deep learning methods are applied on their own, others are applied in combination with more traditional methods, or in an interactive setting. This article surveys the various deep learning methods that have been applied to generate game content directly or indirectly, discusses deep learning methods that could be used for content generation purposes but are rarely used today, and envisages some limitations and potential future directions of deep learning for procedural content generation.},

Three layout creators and three furnishers are introduced in this paper, which can be combined in different ways in the two-step generative process for producing diverse dungeons levels. Layout creators generate the floors and walls of a level, while furnishers populate it with monsters, traps, and treasures.

abstract = "The rapid pace of recent research in AI has been driven in part by the presence of fast and challenging simulation environments. These environments often take the form of games; with tasks ranging from simple board games, to competitive video games. We propose a new benchmark - Obstacle Tower: a high fidelity, 3D, 3rd person, procedurally generated environment 1. An agent playing Obstacle Tower must learn to solve both low-level control and high-level planning problems in tandem while learning from pixels and a sparse reward signal. Unlike other benchmarks such as the Arcade Learning Environment, evaluation of agent performance in Obstacle Tower is based on an agent's ability to perform well on unseen instances of the environment. In this paper we outline the environment and provide a set of baseline results produced by current state-of-the-art Deep RL methods as well as human players. These algorithms fail to produce agents capable of performing near human level.",

Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

abstract = {An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing  developmental encodings , i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

abstract={The creative excitement of the artist at her easel or the scientist in the lab comes as close to the ideal fulfillment as we all hope to, and so rarely do. [The author] interviewed more than 90 [people] who have changed the way people in their fields think and work to find out how creativity has been a force in their lives.  [Building on his state of consciousness flow theory, the author] explores why creative people are often seen as selfish and arrogant (even though they are not) and reveals that the idea of the tortured genius is largely a myth. He argues that creativity needs to be cultivated not only in traditionally creative fields like sciences and arts, but also in business, government, and education.  This book is not so much about the everyday "creativity" that we all experience but the kind of creativity of artists, scientists, and others that can transform our culture and the way we look at the world. By studying the creative lives of exceptional people, Professor Csikszentmihalyi shows us how we can all enhance our everyday lives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract="Understanding player behavior is fundamental in game data science. Video games evolve as players interact with the game, so being able to foresee player experience would help to ensure a successful game development. In particular, game developers need to evaluate beforehand the impact of in-game events. Simulation optimization of these events is crucial to increase player engagement and maximize monetization. We present an experimental analysis of several methods to forecast game-related variables, with two main aims: to obtain accurate predictions of in-app purchases and playtime in an operational production environment, and to perform simulations of in-game events in order to maximize sales and playtime. Our ultimate purpose is to take a step towards the data-driven development of games. The results suggest that even though the performance of traditional approaches, such as ARIMA is still better, the outcomes of state-of-the-art techniques like deep learning are promising. Deep learning comes up as a well-suited general model that could be used to forecast a variety of time series with different dynamic behaviors.",

By exploiting the exceptionally rich datasets recorded by modern video games---which provide information on the individual behavior of each and every player---survival analysis techniques can be used to predict what players are more likely to become paying (or even premium) users and when, both in terms of time and game level, the conversion will take place.Here we show that a traditional semi-parametric model (Cox regression), a random survival forest (RSF) technique and a method based on conditional inference survival ensembles all yield very promising results. However, the last approach has the advantage of being able to correct the inherent bias in RSF models by dividing the procedure into two steps: first selecting the best predictor to perform the splitting and then the best split point for that covariate.The proposed conditional inference survival ensembles method could be readily used in operational environments for early identification of premium players and the parts of the game that may prompt them to become paying users. Such knowledge would allow developers to induce their conversion and, more generally, to better understand the needs of their players and provide them with a personalized experience, thereby increasing their engagement and paving the way to higher monetization.},

abstract = {The route to the solution of complex design problems often lies through intermediate "stepping stones" which bear little resemblance to the final solution. By greedily following the path of greatest fitness improvement, objective-based search overlooks and discards stepping stones which might be critical to solving the problem. Here, we hypothesize that Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are a better way to generate stepping stones than objective-based search: by maintaining a large set of solutions which are of high-quality, but phenotypically different, these algorithms collect promising stepping stones while protecting them in their own "ecological niche". To demonstrate the capabilities of QD we revisit the challenge of recreating images produced by user-driven evolution, a classic challenge which spurred work in novelty search and illustrated the limits of objective-based search. We show that QD far outperforms objective-based search in matching user-evolved images. Further, our results suggest some intriguing possibilities for leveraging the diversity of solutions created by QD.},

abstract = {An ambitious challenge in artificial life is to craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of well-adapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit. However, novelty search, a technique that explicitly rewards diverging, can potentially mitigate such convergence. Thus in this paper an existing creature evolution platform is extended with multi-objective search that balances drives for both novelty and performance. However, there are different ways to combine performance-driven search and novelty search. The suggested approach is to provide evolution with both a novelty objective that encourages diverse morphologies and a local competition objective that rewards individuals outperforming those most similar in morphology. The results in an experiment evolving locomoting virtual creatures show that novelty search with local competition discovers more functional morphological diversity within a single run than models with global competition, which are more predisposed to converge. The conclusions are that novelty search with local competition may complement recent advances in evolving virtual creatures and may in general be a principled approach to combining novelty search with pressure to achieve.},

We further employed machine vision techniques for image categorisation and clustering, and designed a user interface for fast, fun image generation, adhering to numerous principles arising from the study of casual creators. We describe the implementation and experimentation performed during the first stage of development, and evaluate the app in terms of efficiency, image quality, feedback quality and the potential for users to have fun.

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an emerging form of indirect encoding. The GAN is trained to induce a latent space on training data, and a real-valued evolutionary algorithm can search that latent space. Such Latent Variable Evolution (LVE) has recently been applied to game levels. However, it is hard for objective scores to capture level features that are appealing to players. Therefore, this paper introduces a tool for interactive LVE of tile-based levels for games. The tool also allows for direct exploration of the latent dimensions, and allows users to play discovered levels. The tool works for a variety of GAN models trained for both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, and is easily generalizable to other games. A user study shows that both the evolution and latent space exploration features are appreciated, with a slight preference for direct exploration, but combining these features allows users to discover even better levels. User feedback also indicates how this system could eventually grow into a commercial design tool, with the addition of a few enhancements.},

abstract = {Choice-driven narratives, such as those created through systems like Twine, are a compelling form of interactive storytelling that have been around for many years. But as long as this form has existed, it has grappled with a persistent design problem: consistently presenting choices that feel both effective and relevant. Brute force can achieve the desired effect, but usually at the cost of prohibitively high authorial burden. To tackle this, generative approaches, such as Mawhorter's Dunyazad, facilitate authoring procedural choice content for reuse and recombination. However, many such systems, while successful on technical levels, have yet to to be used to author large enough structures to support a full game, and require a high technical threshold for authors to use. To further development in this space, we present StoryAssembler, an open source generative narrative system that creates dynamic choice-driven narratives. It formed a critical part of Emma's Journey, an interactive narrative game, the initial version of which was collaboratively authored by a team of six writers. In the course of the game's creation, useful authoring patterns and design lessons were learned, as well as techniques that made the system approachable for first-time users.},

abstract = {Recent studies have emphasized the merits of search processes that lack overarching objectives, instead promoting divergence by rewarding behavioral novelty. While this less objective search paradigm is more open-ended and divergent, it still differs significantly from nature's mechanism of divergence. Rather than measuring novelty explicitly nature is guided by a single, fundamental constraint: survive long enough to reproduce. Surprisingly, this simple constraint produces both complexity and diversity in a continual process unparalleled by any algorithm to date. Inspired by the relative simplicity of open-endedness in nature in comparison to recent non-objective algorithms, this paper investigates the extent to which interactions between two coevolving populations, both subject to their own constraint, or minimal criterion, can produce results that are both functional and diverse even without any behavior characterization or novelty archive. To test this new approach, a novel maze navigation domain is introduced wherein evolved agents must learn to navigate mazes whose structures are simultaneously coevolving and increasing in complexity. The result is a broad range of maze topologies and successful agent trajectories in a single run, thereby suggesting the viability of minimal criterion coevolution as a new approach to non-objective search and a step towards genuinely open-ended algorithms.},

abstract = {How can progress in machine learning and reinforcement learning be automated to generate its own never-ending curriculum of challenges without human intervention? The recent emergence of quality diversity (QD) algorithms offers a glimpse of the potential for such continual open-ended invention. For example, novelty search showcases the benefits of explicit novelty pressure, MAP-Elites and Innovation Engines highlight the advantage of explicit elitism within niches in an otherwise divergent process, and minimal criterion coevolution (MCC) reveals that problems and solutions can coevolve divergently. The Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm introduced in this paper combines these principles to produce a practical approach to generating an endless progression of diverse and increasingly challenging environments while at the same time explicitly optimizing their solutions. An intriguing implication is the opportunity to transfer solutions among environments, reflecting the view that innovation is a circuitous and unpredictable process. POET is tested in a 2-D obstacles course domain, where it generates diverse and sophisticated behaviors that create and solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved by direct optimization, or by a direct-path curriculum-building control algorithm. We hope that POET will inspire a new push towards open-ended discovery across many domains.},

abstract = {Procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML) is typically framed as the task of fitting a generative model to full-scale examples of a desired content distribution. This approach presents a fundamental tension: the more design effort expended to produce detailed training examples for shaping a generator, the lower the return on investment from applying PCGML in the first place. In response, we propose the use of discriminative models, which capture the validity of a design rather the distribution of the content, trained on positive and negative example design fragments. Through a modest modification of WaveFunctionCollapse, a commercially-adopted PCG approach that we characterize as using elementary machine learning, we demonstrate a new mode of control for learning-based generators. We demonstrate how an artist might craft a focused set of additional positive and negative design fragments by critique of the generator's previous outputs. This interaction mode bridges PCGML with mixed-initiative design assistance tools by working with a machine to define a space of valid designs rather than just one new design.},

As a result, even the most sophisticated systems in this regard, e.g., Game-o-Matic, betray this problem — generating games with goals that are at odds with their mechanics. We describe Gemini, the first bidirectional game generation and analysis system.  Gemini is able to take games as input, perform a proceduralist reading of them, and produce possible interpretations that the games might afford.  By utilizing the declarative nature of Answer Set Programming (ASP), this analysis pathway opens up generation of games targeting specific interpretations and makes it possible to ensure the generated games are consistent with the desired reading. For Gemini, we developed a game specification language capable of expressing a larger domain of games than is possible with VGDL, the most widespread representation. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by generating games in a series of domains.  These domains are based on prototypes hand-created by a team without knowledge of the constraints and capabilities of Gemini.},

abstract = {Hundreds of millions of people play computer games every day. For them, game content—from 3D objects to abstract puzzles—plays a major entertainment role. Manual labor has so far ensured that the quality and quantity of game content matched the demands of the playing community, but is facing new scalability challenges due to the exponential growth over the last decade of both the gamer population and the production costs. Procedural Content Generation for Games (PCG-G) may address these challenges by automating, or aiding in, game content generation. PCG-G is difficult, since the generator has to create the content, satisfy constraints imposed by the artist, and return interesting instances for gamers. Despite a large body of research focusing on PCG-G, particularly over the past decade, ours is the first comprehensive survey of the field of PCG-G. We first introduce a comprehensive, six-layered taxonomy of game content: bits, space, systems, scenarios, design, and derived. Second, we survey the methods used across the whole field of PCG-G from a large research body. Third, we map PCG-G methods to game content layers; it turns out that many of the methods used to generate game content from one layer can be used to generate content from another. We also survey the use of methods in practice, that is, in commercial or prototype games. Fourth and last, we discuss several directions for future research in PCG-G, which we believe deserve close attention in the near future.},

developed as a sub-system to the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) that procedurally
generates objectives for the dungeons created with the tool. The quality of the content
within rooms is used to generate objectives, and together with the distributions and
design of the dungeon, main and side objectives are formed to maximize the usage of
game space and create a proper context.},

abstract = {Though based on abstractions of nature, current evolutionary algorithms and artificial life models lack the drive to complexity characteristic of natural evolution. Thus this paper argues that the prevalent fitness-pressure-based abstraction does not capture how natural evolution discovers complexity. Alternatively, this paper proposes that natural evolution can be abstracted as a process that discovers many ways to express the same functionality. That is, all successful organisms must meet the same minimal criteria of survival and reproduction. This abstraction leads to the key idea in this paper: Searching for novel ways of meeting the same minimal criteria, which is an accelerated model of this new abstraction, may be an effective search algorithm. Thus the existing novelty search method, which rewards any new behavior, is extended to enforce minimal criteria. Such minimal criteria novelty search prunes the space of viable behaviors and may often be more efficient than the search for novelty alone. In fact, when compared to the raw search for novelty and traditional fitness-based search in the two maze navigation experiments in this paper, minimal criteria novelty search evolves solutions more consistently. It is possible that refining the evolutionary computation abstraction in this way may lead to solving more ambitious problems and evolving more complex artificial organisms.},

abstract = {Why does modern life revolve around objectives? From how science is funded, to improving how children are educated -- and nearly everything in-between -- our society has become obsessed with a seductive illusion: that greatness results from doggedly measuring improvement in the relentless pursuit of an ambitious goal. In Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned, Stanley and Lehman begin with a surprising scientific discovery in artificial intelligence that leads ultimately to the conclusion that the objective obsession has gone too far. They make the case that great achievement can't be bottled up into mechanical metrics; that innovation is not driven by narrowly focused heroic effort; and that we would be wiser (and the outcomes better) if instead we whole-heartedly embraced serendipitous discovery and playful creativity. Controversial at its heart, yet refreshingly provocative, this book challenges readers to consider life without a destination and discovery without a compass.}

As an important means for conveying the game's story, quests dictate the setting and contents of levels. Levels provide challenges for the player to overcome in the service of completing quests, and their structure can invite the inclusion of certain kinds of quests. This paper presents an analysis of design patterns present in existing RPGs that aims to better understand such relationships. These patterns identify common design practices for quests and levels at many different levels of granularity.",

abstract = {In game development, software teams often conduct postmortems to reflect on what went well and what went wrong in a project. The postmortems are shared publicly on gaming sites or at developer conferences. In this paper, we present an analysis of 155 postmortems published on the gaming site Gamasutra.com. We identify characteristics of game development, link the characteristics to positive and negative experiences in the postmortems and distill a set of best practices and pitfalls for game development.},

The prototype is focused on the domain of dialog about goals typically handled by receptionists at the front desks of buildings on the Microsoft corporate campus. The system employs a set of Bayesian user models to interpret the goals of speakers given evidence gleaned from a natural language parse of their utterances. Beyond linguistic features, the domain models take into consideration contextual evidence, including visual findings. We discuss key principles of conversational actions under uncertainty and the overall architecture of the system, highlighting the use of a hierarchy of Bayesian models at different levels of detail, the use of value of information to control question asking, and application of expected utility to control progression and backtracking in conversation.},

abstract = {Procedural content generation is generally viewed as a means to an end – a tool employed by designers to overcome technical problems or achieve a particular design goal. When we move from generating single parts of games to automating the entirety of their design, however, we find ourselves facing a far wider and more interesting set of problems than mere generation. When the designer of a game is a piece of software, we face questions about what it means to be a designer, about Computational Creativity, and about how to assess the growth of these automated game designers and the value of their output. Answering these questions can lead to new ideas in how to generate content procedurally, and produce systems that can further the cutting edge of game design. This paper describes work done to take an automated game designer and advance it towards being a member of a creative community. We outline extensions made to the system to give it more autonomy and creative independence, in order to strengthen claims that the software is acting creatively. We describe and reflect upon the software’s participation in the games community, including entering two game development contests, and show the opportunities and difficulties of such engagement. We consider methods for evaluating automated game designers as creative entities, and underline the need for automated game design to be a major frontier in future games research.},

abstract = {Automatically generating content for videogames has long been a staple of game development and the focus of much successful research. Such forays into content generation usually concern themselves with producing a specific game component, such as a level design. This has proven a rich and challenging area of research, but in focusing on creating separate parts of a larger game, we miss out on the most challenging and interesting aspects of game development. By expanding our scope to the automated design of entire games, we can investigate the relationship between the different creative tasks undertaken in game development, tackle the higher-level creative challenges of game design, and ultimately build systems capable of much greater novelty, surprise and quality in their output. This paper, the first in a series of two, describes two case studies in automating game design, proposing cooperative coevo- lution as a useful technique to use within systems that automate this process. We show how this technique allows essentially separate content generators to produce content that complements each other. We also describe systems that have used this to design games with subtle emergent effects. After introducing the technique and its technical basis in this paper, in the second paper in the series we discuss higher level issues in automated game design, such as potential overlap with computational creativity and the issue of evaluation.},

abstract="This paper presents the current state of the online game Iconoscope and analyzes the data collected from almost 45 months of continuous operation. Iconoscope is a freeform creation game which aims to foster the creativity of its users through diagrammatic lateral thinking, as users are required to depict abstract concepts as icons which may be misinterpreted by other users as different abstract concepts. From users' responses collected from an online gallery of all icons drawn with Iconoscope, we collect a corpus of over 500 icons which contain annotations of visual appeal. Several machine learning algorithms are tested for their ability to predict the appeal of an icon from its visual appearance and other properties. Findings show the impact of the representation on the model's accuracy and highlight how such a predictive model of quality can be applied to evaluate new icons (human-authored or generated).",

Using the Constrained MAP-Elites algorithm and the GVG-AI framework, this system generates the simplest tile based levels that contain specific sets of game mechanics and also satisfy playability constraints. We apply this method to illuminate the mechanic space for four different games in GVG-AI: Zelda, Solarfox, Plants, and RealPortals. With this system, we can generate playable levels that contain different combinations of most of the possible mechanics. These levels can later be used to populate game tutorials that teach players how to use the mechanics of the game.},

While Game AI was for a long time not very well recognized by the larger scientific community, it has established itself as a research area for developing and testing the most advanced forms of AI algorithms and articles covering advances in mastering video games such as StarCraft 2 and Quake III appear in the most prestigious journals. Because of the growth of the field, a single review cannot cover it completely. Therefore, we put a focus on important recent developments, including that advances in Game AI are starting to be extended to areas outside of games, such as robotics or the synthesis of chemicals. In this article, we review the algorithms and methods that have paved the way for these breakthroughs, report on the other important areas of Game AI research, and also point out exciting directions for the future of Game AI.},

abstract={Procedural content generation (PCG) refers to the practice of generating game content, such as levels, quests or characters, algorithmically. Motivated by the need to make games replayable, as well as to reduce authoring burden and enable particular aesthetics, many PCG methods have been devised. At the same time that researchers are adapting methods from machine learning (ML) to PCG problems, the ML community has become more interested in PCG-inspired methods. One reason for this development is that ML algorithms often only work for a particular version of a particular task with particular initial parameters. In response, researchers have begun exploring randomization of problem parameters to counteract such overfitting and to allow trained policies to more easily transfer from one environment to another, such as from a simulated robot to a robot in the real world. Here we review existing work on PCG, its overlap with current efforts in ML, and promising new research directions such as procedurally generated learning environments. Although originating in games, we believe PCG algorithms are critical to creating more general machine intelligence.},

Through this approach, we aim for increasing the user's agency over the generated content in a way that neither stalls the user-tool reciprocal stimuli loop nor fatigues the user with periodical suggestion handpicking. We describe the details of this novel solution, as well as its implementation in the MI-CC tool the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer. We present and discuss our findings out of the initial tests carried out, spotting the open challenges for this combined line of research that integrates MI-CC with Procedural Content Generation through Machine Learning.",

abstract = "Evaluation is an open problem in procedural content generation research. The eld is now in a state where there is a glut of content generators, each serving dierent purposes and using a variety of techniques. It is dicult to understand, quantitatively or qualitatively, what makes one generator dierent from another in terms of its output. To remedy this, we have conducted a large-scale comparative evaluation of level generators for the Mario AI Benchmark, a research-friendly clone of the classic platform game Super Mario Bros. In all, we compare the output of seven dierent level generators from the literature, based on dierent algorithmic methods, plus the levels from the original Super Mario Bros game. To compare them, we have dened six expressivity metrics, of which two are novel contributions in this paper. These metrics are shown to provide interestingly dierent characterizations of the level generators. The results presented in this paper, and the accompanying source code, is meant to become a benchmark against which to test new level generators and expressivity metrics.",

abstract = {In contrast to the conventional role of evolution in evolutionary computation (EC)
as an optimization algorithm, a new class of evolutionary algorithms has emerged in
recent years that instead aim to accumulate as diverse a collection of discoveries
as possible, yet where each variant in the collection is as fit as it can be. Often
applied in both neuroevolution and morphological evolution, these new quality diversity
(QD) algorithms are particularly well-suited to evolution's inherent strengths, thereby
offering a promising niche for EC within the broader field of machine learning. However,
because QD algorithms are so new, until now no comprehensive study has yet attempted
to systematically elucidate their relative strengths and weaknesses under different
conditions. Taking a first step in this direction, this paper introduces a new benchmark
domain designed specifically to compare and contrast QD algorithms. It then shows
how the degree of alignment between the measure of quality and the behavior characterization
(which is an essential component of all QD algorithms to date) impacts the ultimate
performance of different such algorithms. The hope is that this initial study will
help to stimulate interest in QD and begin to unify the disparate ideas in the area.},
