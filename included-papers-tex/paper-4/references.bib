It is argued that schema theory, in both cognitive and clinical sciences, allows a focus on mental structures, their biological basis, their development and change, and on the way in which they direct psychological events. It is concluded that the schema construct allows integration within cognitive science, within the clinic, and between the two. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract={A theory was proposed to reconcile paradoxical findings on the invariance of personality and the variability of behavior across situations. For this purpose, individuals were assumed to differ in (a) the accessibility of cognitive--affective mediating units (such as encodings, expectancies and beliefs, affects, and goals) and (b) the organization of relationships through which these units interact with each other and with psychological features of situations. The theory accounts for individual differences in predictable patterns of variability across situations (e.g., if A then she X, but if B then she Y), as well as for overall average levels of behavior, as essential expressions or behavioral signatures of the same underlying personality system. Situations, personality dispositions, dynamics, and structure were reconceptualized from this perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Research using both natural language adjectives and theoretically based personality questionnaires supports the comprehensiveness of the model and its applicability across observers and cultures. The model's history and its supporting evidence are summarized. Conceptions of the nature of the factors are discussed, and an agenda for theorizing about the origins and operation of the factors is presented. Its long history, cross-cultural replication, and empirical validation across many methods and instruments make the 5-factor model a basic discovery of personality psychology.

Since its inception in 1996, the use of items and scales from the IPIP has increased dramatically. Items from the IPIP have been translated from English into more than 25 other languages. Currently over 80 publications using IPIP scales are listed at the IPIP Web site (http://ipip.ori.org), and the rate of IPIP-related publications has been increasing rapidly. The growing popularity of the IPIP can be attributed to five factors: (1) It is cost free; (2) its items can be obtained instantaneously via the Internet; (3) it includes over 2000 items, all easily available for inspection; (4) scoring keys for IPIP scales are provided; and (5) its items can be presented in any order, interspersed with other items, reworded, translated into other languages, and administered on the World Wide Web without asking permission of anyone. The unrestricted availability of the IPIP raises concerns about possible misuse by unqualified persons, and the freedom of researchers to use the IPIP in idiosyncratic ways raises the possibility of fragmentation rather than scientific unification in personality research."

abstract={Cybernetics, the study of goal-directed, adaptive systems, is the best framework for an integrative theory of personality. Cybernetic Big Five Theory attempts to provide a comprehensive, synthetic, and mechanistic explanatory model. Constructs that describe psychological individual differences are divided into personality traits, reflecting variation in the parameters of evolved cybernetic mechanisms, and characteristic adaptations, representing goals, interpretations, and strategies defined in relation to an individual's particular life circumstances. The theory identifies mechanisms in which variation is responsible for traits in the top three levels of a hierarchical trait taxonomy based on the Big Five and describes the causal dynamics between traits and characteristic adaptations. Lastly, the theory links function and dysfunction in traits and characteristic adaptations to psychopathology and well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract={Paul Costa and Robert McCrae argue for the centrality of traits to an understanding of personality. They discuss the issue of the cross-situational consistency of personality traits. They explore the significance of trait theory as a "universal personality structure." Costa and McCrae have been the primary developers of the five-factor model of personality traits. Here, they introduce the five factors: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. They also review research that indicates that these factors are heritable and supports the existence of this model in all cultures studied. Additionally, they present their own research, which demonstrates the stability of these factors during adulthood. They criticize theories that do not integrate what is known about traits as outdated. Finally, they show how traits fit into a comprehensive model of a person, and how this model can be used to guide theory and research in personality.

abstract={It was hypothesized that attraction toward another individual is a positive linear function of the proportion of his personality characteristics which are similar to those of S. In the 1st experiment, 151 Ss examined the responses of a stranger to the Repression-Sensitization (R-S) Scale. The stranger responded as S did on .20, .50, or .80 of the items. Analysis of variance indicated that attraction was affected by proportion of similar responses (p<.001) and by repression-sensitization (p<.01). In a 2nd experiment, employing 149 Ss, attitude similarity influenced attraction (p<.001), but repression-sensitization did not. In the 1st experiment, subject-stranger discrepancy in R-S Scale scores was found to influence attraction (p<.001); represser-sensitizer differences were thus artifactual. The relationship between personality similarity and attraction is entirely consistent with the findings of attitude-similarity studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
