%\section{Future Work} \label{p2future-work}

We aim to further evaluate the system with different configurations and observe how the different fitness functions can interact and cooperate with each other to create more interesting content, as well as, joining both approaches for a case study, similar to the one done by Baldwin et al \cite{p2Baldwin2017TowardsGeneration}. It would be interesting to continue using aesthetic concepts, for instance, density, simplicity, sparseness and individuality, to evaluate the content 

Further use the division of the map by performing zone analysis, which could result on suggesting changes to the designers in order to fulfill different player models, similar to Holmg\r{a}rd's approach \cite{p2Holmgard2014EvolvingModeling} or do a separated evolution on the manually locked tiles providing the designers with interesting shapes and patterns. Finally, we would like to go down the road towards more indirect encodings and test different approaches and, compare and measure the differences and advantages of the resulting maps.
