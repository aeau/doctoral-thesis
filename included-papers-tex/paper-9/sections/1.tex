%Procedural Content Generation (PCG) and AI-human blended approaches are two of the most promising focus areas for future game research in AI \citepninth{p9Risi2020GameAI}. PCG has now moved on from generating specific game content to almost complete game worlds \citepninth{p9nomansky,aidungeon}, as well as procedural learning environments and better benchmarks for training learning agents~\citepninth{p9Risi2020-pcgGeneralityML}. Evolutionary Computation (EC) is one of the dominant techniques in PCG \citepninth{p9yannakakis2014panorama}. 
Mixed-initiative co-creativity (MI-CC) \citepninth{p9yannakakis2014micc}, is a human-AI collaborative approach where both human and computer have a proactive role in the creation of content~\citepninth{p9liapis_generating_2013}. %shaker2013ropossum,
Recent research shows the importance of using quality-diversity (QD) algorithms \citepninth{p9Pugh2016,p9gravina2019procedural} to better drive the evolutionary process in complex search spaces by generating stepping stones that barely resemble the optimal solution \citepninth{p9gaier2019quality}. A popular QD implementation in recent research is MAP-Elites \citepninth{p9Mouret2015}, which has been applied to generate levels for bullet hell games \citepninth{p9Khalifa2018}, dungeon levels for MI-CC generation of adventure games~\citepninth{p9alvarez2019empowering}, and levels for puzzle games~\citepninth{p9charity2020baba}.% and mechanic-targeted level generation in Super Mario Bros \citepninth{p9Khalifa2019-intentionalCompLevel} and several games running on the GVG-AI framework \citepninth{p9charity2020mech}.  
% \begin{itemize}
%\item \citepninth{p9Khalifa2018} presented constrained MAP-Elites, a combination MAP-Elites with the feasible-infeasible concept from the FI2Pop genetic algorithm~\citepninth{p9Kimbrough2008}, and applied this to procedurally generating levels for bullet hell games. Another implementation of MAP-Elites has been recently used to produce small sections of Super Mario Bros levels called \textit{scenes}, addressing specific game mechanics \citepninth{p9Khalifa2019-intentionalCompLevel}.
% \item Mech-Elites: Illuminating the Mechanic Space of GVGAI \citepninth{p9charity2020mech} r introduces a fully automatic method of mechanic illumination for general video game level generation. Using the Constrained MAP-Elites algorithm and the GVG-AI framework
%\item  Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are a better way to generate stepping stones than objective-based search \citepninth{p9gaier2019quality}

%As the interest of the research community in PCG and MI-CC rises, so does the need for improving the ways for evaluating these novel approaches.
The rising interest of the evolutionary computation and computational intelligence in games research community in PCG, MI-CC and MAP-Elites, %drives the need 
calls for improving the ways for evaluating these novel approaches. Some of the main problems in mixed-initiative tools are the inadequate consideration of the costs and benefits for every automated action, as well as failing to spot the opportunities for users to guide the invocation of the automated services \citepninth{p9Horvitz99-mixedInit}. 
% Moreover, two of the design guidelines for AI-human interaction presented in \citepninth{p9amershi2019guidelines} address the need for facilitating users ways to edit and refine the AI system, and clearly communicating them why this system behaves as it does.
%The area of eXplainable AI for Designers (XAID) \citepninth{p9Zhu2018-XAIDesignersMICC} strives for %highlights the importance of 
%achieving system explainability %and concludes that this is 
%necessarily built on \textit{understandings of both algorithmic properties of the underlying AI techniques and the needs of human designers}. Similarly, Compton reflects on the so-called grokloop \citepninth{p9ComptonPhD}: the creative feedback MI-CC loop where a user builds a hypothesis, modifies a system, evaluates the result, and then updates the system. Shorter grokloops improve the overall performance of the mutual inspiration, and attempting to shorten this loop implies a clear understanding and interpretation of the relationship between each user action and the changes that it triggers in the system.

% This study further evaluates the Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites, a continuous evolutionary process that takes advantage of MAP-Elites to provide QD procedurally generated dungeons, introduced in~\citepninth{p9alvarez2019empowering}. This explores the effects of continuous evolution and dimensions customization in an MI-CC approach. An in-depth analysis on the algorithm's expressive range of all feature-dimension pairs was presented in~\citepninth{p9Alvarez2020-ICMAPE} as the first step towards understanding how the generated solutions relate to all the dimensions included in the search space. 

%OLD
%In this paper we explore, analyze and discuss the dynamics of QD algorithms using the Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites in the domain of level generation of 2D adventure games. Through this we explore how IC MAP-Elites responds, reacts, and adapts to the editions and changes done by a designer in a mixed-initiative loop. We present results of the stability of the algorithm while constantly exploring for high-performing solutions in the generative space. Results also show that the interactive designer-algorithm loop opens up areas for exploration that previously seemed mutually exclusive regions of the search space.

MAP-Elites have shown excellent results at generating QD individuals in games~\citepninth{p9fontaine2019covariance,p9Alvarez2020-ICMAPE}, and offline adaptation based on its generated repertoire~\citepninth{p9Cully2015-qdRobotsAnimals,p9Gonzalez-Duque2020-DifficultyTrialError}. However, MAP-Elites generation capabilities have been mostly evaluated in non-interactive scenarios and based on its final result even when used in interactive situations~\citepninth{p9charity2020baba,p9alvarez2019empowering}. This results in a lack of research to assess the effects and consequences of interacting with MAP-Elites, and the adaptability and stability properties of MAP-Elites in dynamic scenarios. 

%MAP-Elites have shown excellent results at generating QD individuals in several areas such as games~\citepninth{p9fontaine2019covariance,Alvarez2020-ICMAPE} and robotics~\citepninth{p9nordmoen2020-MAPElitesStepStonesRobotics,Cully2019-QDAutonomousSkillDiscovery}, and offline adaptation based on its generated repertoire~\citepninth{p9Cully2015-qdRobotsAnimals,Gonzalez-Duque2020-DifficultyTrialError}. However, MAP-Elites generation capabilities have been mostly evaluated in non-interactive scenarios and based on its final result even when used in interactive situations~\citepninth{p9charity2020baba,alvarez2019empowering}. This results in a lack of research to assess the effects and consequences of interacting with MAP-Elites for both user and algorithm and the adaptability and stability properties of MAP-Elites in dynamic and interactive scenarios. 

% This hinders MAP-Elites' evaluation 

% Previous results 

% Previous results on \textit{"static"} evaluations for MAP-Elites suggests that both, the range of individuals generated and their performance, will be higher than other algorithms~\citepninth{p9cvt-mape2016,cully2020-multiemitter,Gravina2019-blendingNotionsDiversity}. However, the effects of this interactive loop and "dialogue" between user and algorithm, the continuous development, and ... is unknown. MAP-Elites have been used in interactive situations before~\citepninth{p9alvarez2019empowering,charity2020baba} and even used for modeling preferences and adapting its evaluation based on that with positive results~\citepninth{p9Alvarez2020-DesignerPreference}. Nevertheless, studies focus on evaluating MAP-Elites on static scenarios without any human interaction. Therefore, this paper aims at analyzing how interaction improves the evolutionary process and the mixed-initiative creative process in MAP-Elites.

% it has not been evaluated on the interactive system rather it has always been evaluated in a static scenario and on its own. Thus, we seek to answer is there any benefit for MAP-Elites and the user for using MAP-Elites in an interactive system?

% While MAP-Elites have shown excellent results for the generation of high-performing and diverse individuals in games~\citepninth{p9fontaine2019covariance}, robotics~\citepninth{p9Cully2015-qdRobotsAnimals}, and other areas, and have highlighted the benefits from its generated repertoire for more than creating diverse individuals, but also to allow rapid adaptation~\citepninth{p9Cully2015-qdRobotsAnimals,Gonzalez-Duque2020-DifficultyTrialError}
% For instance, imagine the scenario where an user is designing a robot piece by piece or some 3d objective?= in a CAD software that uses some type of recommendation, suggestions, assistance, or some type of mixed-initiative system. If we use an evolutionary algorithm for this assistance system, we will be able to explore the space vastly based on some type of objective, which if using \textit{interactive evolution} can be adaptive and provided by the user. Now, if we use MAP-Elites, based on previous results on \textit{"static"} evaluations, it can be estimated that both the range of individuals generated and their performance will be higher than other algorithms~\citepninth{p9cvt-mape2016,cully2020-multiemitter,Gravina2019-blendingNotionsDiversity}. However, the effects of this interactive loop and "dialogue" between user and algorithm, the continuous development, and ... is unknown. MAP-Elites have been used in interactive situations before~\citepninth{p9alvarez2019empowering,charity2020baba} and even used for modeling preferences and adapting its evaluation based on that~\citepninth{p9Alvarez2020-DesignerPreference} with good performance and positive results. Yet, it has not been evaluated on the interactive system rather it has always been evaluated in a static scenario and on its own. Thus, we seek to answer is there any benefit for MAP-Elites and the user for using MAP-Elites in an interactive system?

%IC MAP-Elites for level generation of 2D adventure games. IC MAP-Elites is evaluated using simulated pre-recorded design sessions with different design goals that displays the algorithm's stability and adaptability properties, and benefits. We present results of the stability of the algorithm while constantly exploring high-performing solutions in the generative space. Results also show that the interactive designer-algorithm loop opens areas for exploration that previously seemed mutually exclusive regions of the search space.

Therefore, the contributions of this paper are two-fold. On the one hand, we present Temporal Expressive Range Analysis (TERA) as a novel way to analyze interactive PCG. TERAs allow us to inspect and analyze the changes in the expressive range over a defined period, which in our case, are design editions. On the other hand, using TERAs, we explored and analyzed how population dynamics react and adapt to constant changes in the IC MAP-Elites for level generation of 2D adventure games. IC MAP-Elites is evaluated using simulated pre-recorded design sessions with different design goals that display the algorithm's stability and adaptability properties and benefits. Our results show that IC MAP-Elites stably encounters high-performing solutions while adapting to changes in the design, and by doing this, regions of the search space which previously seemed inaccessible are opened for exploration.
