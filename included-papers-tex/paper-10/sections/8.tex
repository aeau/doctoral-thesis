% In this paper, we thoroughly discuss the procedure to create designer personas focused on level design generation. We used a prototype implementation in EDD to exemplify the process and the type of information that can be understood and produced from using the archetypical paths. Our work contributes to an alternative route to designer modeling through clustering the design space and the room style based on level design step sequences. These contributions allow us to better understand, cluster, categorize and isolate designer behavior. This is very valuable for mixed-initiative approaches, where a clear virtual model of the designer's style allows us to better drive the search process for procedurally generating content that is valuable for and aligned with the designers intentions.

Our work draws on many of Liapis et al.'s~\citeptenth{p10Liapis2013-designerModel,p10Liapis2014-designerModelImpl} ideas, concepts, and goals but differs on the tool and type of game being created and the methods to create designer models. These differences strengthen the importance and usefulness of designer modeling and highlight this designer-centric perspective's holistic and generic properties.

The archetypical paths presented in sec.~\ref{sec:archetypical-paths} relate to EDD and the options that exist within it. However, while important for EDD's development, this is used to demonstrate what can be done and as an exemplification of the method to model designers. Our method focuses on designer modeling through clustering the design space and the room style based on level design step sequences, resulting in archetypical paths. We leverage a collective dataset to build a collective cluster model of a set of designers and utilize this to mitigate, to some extent, problems regarding lack of individual designer data and continuous model adaptation~\citeptenth{p10Alvarez2020-DesignerPreference}. Our method allows us to better understand, cluster, categorize and isolate designer behavior. A virtual model of the designer's style could allow to better drive the search process for procedurally generating content that is valuable for designers and aligned with the designers' intentions, observed as well by Liapis et al.~\citeptenth{p10Liapis2013-designerModel}.

We expect that work on similar domains and tools working with level design could discuss these archetypical paths in relation to what designers create. They can build on and adapt the proposed method to model designers to their respective domains, identifying valuable and applicable designer personas. Then, these could be used to understand what designers create and to design adaptive systems and better Human-AI collaborations and interactions. The resulting Designer Personas have the potential to be used in many different scenarios. For instance, as objectives for a search-based approach to enable a more style-sensitive system, to evaluate the fitness of evolutionary generated content, or to train PCG agents via Reinforcement Learning~\citeptenth{p10khalifa2020-pcgrl}.

%I'd watch out for that in the discussion section as well, particularly with the sentence starting with "This is very valuable for mixed-initiative approaches,". Second, the third and final paragraph of the discussion starts with two lengthy and somewhat confusing sentences that may be run-ons. I'd recommend breaking these two sentences into four smaller sentences for readability. Otherwise, I think everything looks good.
