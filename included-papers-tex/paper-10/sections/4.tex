\subsection{Concepts and Definitions}

%This paper presents an approach and fundamental steps towards the implementation of designer personas: an analysis of designer style clustering to isolate archetypical paths that can be later be used to build ML surrogate models of archetypal designers. Such models would adapt to the dynamic designer during the mixed-initiative creative process by being placed in the solution space, allowing the designer to traverse such space of models as she drifts through the many dimensions of her creative process.

Our work draws from ideas, concepts, and definitions introduced by Liapis et al., such as the core designer model loop when using CAD tools, what can be modeled: preferences, style, goals, processes, and their definition, and particularly, the use of designer modeling as an individual or collective model~\citeptenth{p10Liapis2013-designerModel}. We support our approach on the idea of style as a particular type of designer's preference, and that a collective model can be used to form a stable and static design space, which after being interacted with by designers, can be adapted towards them.

%Our work draws from many of the ideas and concepts introduced by Liapis et al.~\citeptenth{p10Liapis2013-designerModel}, in relation to style, goals, preferences and design processes of designers. Nevertheless, given the interdisciplinary scope of this system, and the multiple concepts discussed throughout the paper, it is essential to have operational definitions on the different terms used.

%Thus, in this paper, the shared goal is set and defined by the designer with her design, and as she develops, adapts, and changes, the system seeks to adjust its goals to support the designer's work. Furthermore, the aim of this paper is to propose a system that is able to identify the designer's current goal and style to adapt further the system's goals to provide a personalized experience.

\subsubsection{Design Style} \label{sec:designStyle}

%Every designer has a different style when creating content, especially levels, where one might 

% One idea is to train a supervised learning model on traces of other collaborative creation session and try to predict the next step the human would take in the design process. The main problem with this is that people are different, and different creators will want to take different design actions in the same state;

% One way of overcoming this problem could be to change the level of abstraction at which design actions are modeled and predicted. Instead of predicting individual edits, one could identify different styles or phases of the artifact being created, and model how a designer moves from one to another. To put this concretely in the context of designing rooms for a Zelda-like dungeon crawler~\citeptenth{p10tloz}, one could classify room styles depending on whether they were enemy onslaughts, complex wall mazes, treasure puzzles, and so on. One could then train models to recognize which types of rooms a user creates in which order. By clustering sequences of styles or phases we could formulate designer personas as archetypical trajectories through style space, rather than as sequences of individual edits. For example, in the context of creating a dungeon crawler, some designers might start with the outer walls of the rooms and then populate it with NPCs, whereas another type of designer might first sketch the path they would like the player to take from the entrance to the exit and then add parts of the room outside the main path.

There exist many different styles when creating content, especially levels, that designers can create and adapt to accomplish their goals and the experiences they want for players. On a general level, \emph{Design Style} encompasses the creative process from conceptualization, prototyping, reflection, adaptation, especially when following different processes or constraints during collaboration. Taking a more concrete and operational level, \emph{Design Style} can be analyzed as overarching goals that different designers have when creating a dungeon. For instance, dungeons in games such as Zelda\citeptenth{p10tloz} or The Binding of Isaac\citeptenth{p10mcmillen_binding_2011}, represent a particular playing style planned by the designer. In the former, low tempo, exploring the dungeon, and secret rooms define the style of the dungeons, whereas in the latter, high tempo, optimizing time and resources, small rooms, and in general high-challenge define the dungeons. 

While interesting and relevant to understanding the designers' holistic design process and the expected player experience, \emph{Design Style} can also be discussed on an individual room basis. Rooms have their own set of characteristics and styles that can be identified and modeled to understand their design process. Some would prefer to create the room's architecture first to then create the goals within, whereas others would like to place strategic objectives around and then create the architecture around it or alternating between both. Even with such a division, how to reach those design styles is not straightforward and does not require the same strategy, which also shows the preference and style of individual designers. For instance, if the goal is to create a challenge to reach a door, the designer could create a room with a substantial number of enemies, create a concentrated high-challenge in the center of the room, or divide the room into smaller choke areas. Therefore, in this paper, we take a simplified view of \emph{Design Style} and treat it as the style designers follow to create a room, informed by the individual steps each has taken connected to their preferences and goals.

% While this is a simplified view of \emph{Design Style}, we acknowledge that this is a simplified view of \emph{Design Style}, as this could encompass 

% I take some issue with the framing of the paper as being one of modeling someone’s “design style” based only on the sequence of design actions taken as evidenced in snapshots of a design process. To be clear, I think the snapshot approach is a perfectly reasonable one.  But I worry that giving it a term as all-encompassing as “design style” is overpromising, because there is so much about someone’s approach to design that is lost in reducing it to a sequence of partial designs: moments of self-reflection, prototyping and throwing away ideas before moving to new ones, experimentation on paper away from the machine, prior exposure to design and how it informs new design choices, adherence to norms of genre. Obviously these cannot be captured through this approach, nor do they need to be for the work to be valid. Nonetheless, it seems unfair to characterize “design style” as a mere sequence of edit operations.

% I think more precise language would also make clearer what the strengths and limitations of this study are. By naming the aspects of design that are not captured, it makes clear what potential future work there is, how this approach should and should not be applied in other design tools, and the extent to which this work may be generalizable across tools and genres.

% I think this issue also comes up in cluster labeling. Some of the cluster labels refer to properties of room layout (e.g. “maze-like complex architecture”; “dense room”), some to meta-aspects of design (e.g. “high challenge, clear goal”), some to types of actions (e.g. “separating and populating chambers”, “balancing and optimizing”). It seems like it should be possible for a room to fall into two of these labeled clusters simultaneously (e.g. a maze-like room that has many enemies and a clear goal at the end of the maze), and it’s confusing that these are separate clusters. The same is true for other cluster pairs (e.g. “bordered rooms with deeper architectural development” and “dense, full-range leniency” seem like they could co-exist). It’s also not clear how these cluster labels are applied (other than a “qualitative analysis” — but was this done by the research team, or by external experts? how was this evaluated?).

While this view is interesting to understand the designer's holistic design process; in this paper we threat Design Style specifically as the style designers follow to create a room, informed by the individual steps each has taken.

% \subsubsection{Designer's Goals}

% Usually, designers' goals are linked to the experiences they want to create for players, however, in a MI-CC tool, the goal is defined as the 

% It is identified as the 
% The designer's goal is defined as the current state of rooms and the set of interactions done in the tool or sequence of steps taken thus far, to reach such a state. Goals by the designer are linked to the addition and strategic placement of enemies and treasures, giving some goal for the player, e.g., forcing the fight with an enemy or allowing the player to avoid the conflict through side paths.



%Specifically, this definition is used as the current goal to be achieve by the designer identified as the sequence of steps taken thus far. Goals by the designer are linked to the addition and strategic placement of enemies and treasures, which gives some type of goal for the player, e.g. force the fight with an enemy or give the opportunity for the player to avoid the conflict through side paths. 

%Moreover, in EDD the designer is tasked to create a dungeon with an unlimited amount of interconnected rooms where each room can be further designed on it's own. When designing the dungeon and the rooms, the designers have the freedom to create the rooms as they want with any goal for the player. For instance, if the goal of the designer is to create a boss room, she might create a room with some narrow corridors that end up in a fight with a boss.



% \subsubsection{System Goals}

% The system goals are defined as the system's approach to support and foster the work of the designer by providing suggestions aligned with her current design or giving assistance, information, visualization, and measurements when needed. In general, when providing suggestions, the system aims at generating rooms among multiple areas of the generative space, simultaneously providing rooms adapted to the designer's goal and different from it. 




%The system's goal is to support the work of the designer by providing assistance, information, and measurement when needed. The system's main feature is the provided suggestions by means of the Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites~\citeptenth{p10Alvarez2020-ICMAPE}. These suggestions adapts to the current room's design by automatically modifying the fitness function in favor of the new features of the room such as enemy and treasure ratios or the balance between corridors and open chambers. Through this suggestions, the goal is to provide possible designs in the generative space for the designer while fostering her creativity by presenting suggestions that might not have been considered by her.




% \subsubsection{Shared Goals}

% The shared goals between the system and the designer are defined as the goals the designer has when creating the dungeon and the individual rooms. Thus, in this paper, the shared goal is set and defined by the designer with her design, and as she develops, adapts, and changes, the system seeks to adjust its goals to support the designer's work. Furthermore, the aim of this paper is to propose a system that is able to identify the designer's current goal and style to adapt further the system's goals to provide a personalized experience.
