\textbf{\textsc{ABSTRACT}}

We propose the Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity solution for game content generation, implemented as a new feature of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD): a mixed-initiative co-creativity tool for designing dungeons. The feature uses the MAP-Elites algorithm, an illumination algorithm that segregates the population among several cells depending on their scores with respect to different behavioral dimensions. Users can flexibly and dynamically alternate between these dimensions anytime, thus guiding the evolutionary process in an intuitive way, and then incorporate suggestions produced by the algorithm in their room designs. At the same time, any modifications performed by the human user will feed back into MAP-Elites, closing a circular workflow of constant mutual inspiration. This paper presents the algorithm followed by an in-depth %analysis of its behaviour, with the aims of evaluating 
evaluation of the expressive range of all possible dimension combinations in several scenarios, %as well as discussing 
and discusses their influence in the fitness landscape and in the overall performance of the %mixed-initiative 
procedural content generation in EDD.
