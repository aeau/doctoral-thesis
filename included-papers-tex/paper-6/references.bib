title = "A Comparative Evaluation of Procedural Level Generators in the Mario AI Framework",
abstract = "Evaluation is an open problem in procedural content generation research. The eld is now in a state where there is a glut of content generators, each serving dierent purposes and using a variety of techniques. It is dicult to understand, quantitatively or qualitatively, what makes one generator dierent from another in terms of its output. To remedy this, we have conducted a large-scale comparative evaluation of level generators for the Mario AI Benchmark, a research-friendly clone of the classic platform game Super Mario Bros. In all, we compare the output of seven dierent level generators from the literature, based on dierent algorithmic methods, plus the levels from the original Super Mario Bros game. To compare them, we have dened six expressivity metrics, of which two are novel contributions in this paper. These metrics are shown to provide interestingly dierent characterizations of the level generators. The results presented in this paper, and the accompanying source code, is meant to become a benchmark against which to test new level generators and expressivity metrics.",

abstract = "With the growing use of automated content creation and computer-aided design tools in game development, there is potential for enhancing the design process through personalized interactions between the software and the game developer. This paper proposes designer modeling for capturing the designer's preferences, goals and processes from their interaction with a computer-aided design tool, and suggests methods and domains within game development where such a model can be applied. We describe how designer modeling could be integrated with current work on automated and mixed-initiative content creation, and envision future directions which focus on personalizing the processes to a designer's particular wishes.",
