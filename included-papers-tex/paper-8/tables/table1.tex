\caption{displaying the actions together with Doran and  Parberry's~\cite{Doran2011-questsMMORPGs} prerequisites and how the actions and the previously mentioned prerequisites have been implemented in EDD. This indirectly explains the “unlocking” - describing what tiles that must be placed for an action to be available. Note that “Goto” \& “Explore” do not have any special tile prerequisites besides available floor. }
