\subsection{Conclusions}



% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Discussion on what does this archetypical design trajectories mean?
%     \item how to use them? next steps into integrating this into a system. To use this in a search-based approach as objectives for the generation to move towards the directions where (according to our archetypical design trajectories) the designers will move towards in their design process. Perhaps I could also bring the discussion from the workshop-paper for HC-AI.
%     \item discussion on creativity? is the output or the process where the actual creativity is outputted? Compare using end-design clustering to using sequences to cluster.
%     \item Discussion on how PCGRL relates to this type of work? --> Perhaps this is something for the background instead.

This paper presents a novel approach and meaningful steps towards designer modeling through an experiment on archetypical design trajectories analysis in an MI-CC environment. Through this, we characterize several representative design styles as designer personas. We have first run and compared several clustering setups to find the best partitioning of the design style using the edition sequences of the collected $180$ unique rooms, ending in $8196$ data points, and resulting in a set of twelve cohesive, coherent, and meaningful clusters. We have then mapped these $180$ design sequences in terms of these clusters, applying frequent sequence mining to find four frequent and unique designer styles, with related common sub-styles. As a result, we have presented a roadmap of design styles over a map of data-driven design clusters.

% Our work draws on the ideas, concepts, and goals and concepts proposed by Liapis et al. when introducing the Designer Modeling as a model to capture multiple designer's processes. A prototype of such was implemented in the sentient sketchbook~\citepsixth{p6Liapis2014-designerModelImpl}, where it is proposed the use of interactive evolution by biasing the search space in favor of hand-crafted features of the design. we propose an alternative and novel route to designer modeling through clustering the design space and the room style based on the collected data. Moreover, we differ as well on the type of level design, being the sentient sketchbook a tool for strategy games~\citepsixth{p6liapis_generating_2013}, while EDD a tool for adventure and rogue-like games~\citepsixth{p6Alvarez2020-ICMAPE}. These differences strengthen the importance and usefulness of designer modeling, and highlight the holistic and generic properties of this designer-centric perspective.

Designer modeling was proposed as an approach to capture multiple designer's processes to create a better workflow by Liapis et al.~\citepsixth{p6Liapis2013-designerModel}, and our work draws on many of their ideas, concepts, and goals. Furthermore, a prototype of such was implemented in the sentient sketchbook~\citepsixth{p6Liapis2014-designerModelImpl}, where it is proposed different approaches to model style, process, and goals based on choice-based evolution and the designer's current design to adapt the provided suggestions accordingly. We propose an alternative route to designer modeling through clustering the design space and the room style based on the collected data. Moreover, we differ in the type of level design, being the sentient sketchbook a tool for strategy games~\citepsixth{p6liapis_generating_2013}, while EDD is a tool for adventure and rogue-like games~\citepsixth{p6Alvarez2020-ICMAPE}. These differences strengthen the importance and usefulness of designer modeling and highlight the holistic and generic properties of this designer-centric perspective and its possibilities.

% While the approach described in this paper is applied in a tool for creating zelda-like dungeon games~\citepsixth{p6tloz}, the approach can be reused and extended to other domains 

These contributions allow us to better understand, cluster, categorize and isolate designer behavior. This is very valuable for mixed-initiative approaches, where a clear virtual model of the designer's style allows us to better drive the search process for procedurally generating content that is valuable for the designer. Designer personas have the potential to be used in many different scenarios. For instance, as objectives for a search-based approach to enable a more style-sensitive system, to evaluate the fitness of evolutionary generated content or to train PCG agents via Reinforcement Learning~\citepsixth{p6khalifa2020-pcgrl}. 

Moreover, recognizing the designers' current style and the path taken so far, which would indicate a possible designer persona, could open the possibility for recognizing their intentions, preferences, and goals. This traced roadmap of designer personas could let a content generator anticipate a designer's next moves without heavy computational cost, just by identifying her current location on the map and offering content suggestions that lie in the most promising clusters to be visited next. Conversely, it could also identify designers who do not follow a certain path, i.e. deviating from the pattern, trying to understand their objective through their design style.

% Finally, in our work, we did not observe any type of cross-path i.e. a design going from one path to another. We believe that this is due to the level at which we observe the archetypical paths. However, preliminary analysis on the dataset used in this paper and as expected, the design process of designed rooms within the same dungeon does follow different paths, and sometimes even crossing each other. This opens an interesting and exciting area to explore a wider layer, taking rooms as a set of archetypical paths taken by designers. Observing the paths taken in previous and future rooms, and the dungeon as a whole, as briefly introduced in section~\ref{p6sec:designStyle}, to understand the designers' intentions and goals when they proceed to create a new room is a promising future step to take with the current system. 

%  i.e. room-wise, as the designer typically would design the room with a set of goals

Finally, it is also important to observe the nature of the previous and future rooms created by a designer. Observing the dungeon as a whole, as briefly introduced in section~\ref{p6sec:designStyle}, to understand the designers' intentions and goals when they proceed to create a new room is a promising future step to take with the current system. 

% Furthermore, the designer personas addresses the dynamic-dynamic system vs. dynamic-static system open question raised by Alvarez and Font~\citepsixth{p6Alvarez2020-DesignerPreference}, which relates to the challenge of adapting a system to the a ever-changing designer. With the use of the archetypical paths, the model is not anymore adapting and moving through the solution space with the designer, rather the designer traverse through an already clustered space. 

% With the use of the archetypical paths, we can not only identify the current designer persona the designer is following but we can also adapt and anticipate to what they might end up doing. 

% Furthermore, the designer personas addresses an open question raised by Alvarez and Font \citepsixth{p6Alvarez2020-DesignerPreference}, related to the challenges  using a dynamic-dynamic system vs. a dynamic-static system. The authors describe the dynamic-dynamic system as a system where both designer and AI-system move through the solution space, with the AI-system constantly trying to adapt to the designer. They concluded that the main challenge correspond to designers constantly concept drifting resulting in them continuously changing their decisions. Instead, the authors proposed the use of a dynamic-static system, where the model is not anymore adapting and moving through the solution space with the designer, rather the designer traverse through an already clustered space. With the use of the archetypical paths, we can not only identify the current designer persona the designer is following but we can also adapt and anticipate to what they might end up doing.

% From the $180$ unique rooms, we extracted and used the edition sequence of each of the rooms, from their initial design to the more elaborated end-design, to compose a richer dataset that could capture the design process of a designer rather than focusing on the end-point. Through this, we ended up using $8196$ data points in our dataset.
