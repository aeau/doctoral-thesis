title = {Questgram [Qg]: Toward a Mixed-Initiative Quest Generation Tool},
year = {2021},
publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},
address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {Quests are a core element in many games, especially \emph{role-playing} and \emph{adventure} games, where quests drive the gameplay and story, engage the player in the game’s narrative, and in most cases, act as a bridge between different game elements. The automatic generation of quests and objectives is an interesting challenge since this can extend the lifetime of games such as in \emph{Skyrim}, or can help create unique experiences such as in \emph{AI Dungeon}. This work presents Questgram [Qg], a mixed-initiative prototype tool for creating quests using grammars combined in a mixed-initiative level design tool. We evaluated our tool quantitatively by assessing the generated quests and qualitatively through a small user study. Human designers evaluated the system by creating quests \emph{manually}, \emph{automatically}, and through \emph{mixed-initiative}. Our results show the QuestGram's potential, which creates diverse, valid, and interesting quests using quest patterns. Likewise, it helps engage designers in the quest design process, fosters their creativity by inspiring them, and enhance the level generation facet of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer with steps towards intertwining both level and quest design.},

abstract = {With the growth of procedural content generation in game development, there is a need
for a viable generative method to give context and make sense of the content within
game space. We propose procedural narrative as context through objectives, as a useful
means to structure content in games. In this paper, we present and describe an artifact
developed as a sub-system to the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) that procedurally
generates objectives for the dungeons created with the tool. The quality of the content
within rooms is used to generate objectives, and together with the distributions and
design of the dungeon, main and side objectives are formed to maximize the usage of
game space and create a proper context.},

abstract = {As tabletop games are ported to digital versions to increase their accessibility,
the expected User Experience (UX) might be degraded in the transition. This paper
aims to understand how and why playing tabletop games differentiates depending on
the platform. Seven tabletop games have been chosen from different genres with an
official digital adaptation. Our approach has been to do a comparative analysis of
both versions followed by a user study to analyze and measure the UX differences,
measuring five key factors, Usability, Engagement, Social Connectivity, Aesthetics,
and Enjoyment. Our results indicate that games that rely on imperfect information
offer a much higher social connectivity and engagement when played around a table.
Meanwhile, games relying on tile-placement offers higher usability and engagement
when played digitally due to the assistance provided by the game. However, the physical
versions got, in general, a higher rating than the digital versions in all key factors
except slightly in the usability. Physical versions are the preferred options, but
the digital versions' benefits, such as accessibility and in-game assistance, makes
them relevant for further analysis.},
