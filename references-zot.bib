	abstract = {Writing is a notoriously time-consuming and challenging activity that is difficult to avoid during the development of a game, and the steady increase in complexity behind producing games is putting pressure on the industry to cut unnecessary costs and streamline processes. With recent breakthroughs in Neural Network research the capabilities of causal language models like the GPT models made by OpenAI have reached a level where they could be used to assist with creative assignments that previously only could be done to an acceptable level of quality by a human writer. This paper aims to combine the power of a language model with the versatility and control of the Mixed-Initiative Co-Creation approach. In order to limit the scope of the artifact to a manageable size the focus will be to generate a shorter biography with backstory for characters and items in a level made in the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer by Alvarez et al. The artifact was evaluated with a user study in which both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback was collected. The results suggest that the artifact has potential as it has the ability to generate compelling narratives and users attested that it had a positive effect on their work.},

Existing procedural content generation methods, such as search-based, solver-based, rule-based and grammar-based methods have been applied to various content types such as levels, maps, character models, and textures. A research field centered on content generation in games has existed for more than a decade. More recently, deep learning has powered a remarkable range of inventions in content production, which are applicable to games. While some cutting-edge deep learning methods are applied on their own, others are applied in combination with more traditional methods, or in an interactive setting. This article surveys the various deep learning methods that have been applied to generate game content directly or indirectly, discusses deep learning methods that could be used for content generation purposes but are rarely used today, and envisages some limitations and potential future directions of deep learning for procedural content generation.},

	abstract = {Telling a story is a difficult task that requires a variety of knowledge and cognitive processes: knowledge about themes, writing techniques, the story world, and presentation; processes such as planning, problem-solving, recall and creativity. This dissertation presents a model of the storytelling process which incorporates theories of creativity, memory and author-level planning. This model has been implemented in a computer program called MINSTREL which tells short, theme-based stories about King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.    MINSTREL's creativity process is based upon creativity heuristics called Transform-Recall-Adapt Methods (TRAMs). Each TRAM integrates a simple problem transformation which searches the problem-space for new knowledge to apply to a problem with a corresponding adaptation which can adapt any discovered knowledge to the original problem. By using TRAMs to augment the problem-solving process, MINSTREL is able to invent useful new problem solutions. By incorporating creativity into the recall process, MINSTREL makes creativity available to any cognitive process, and permits the use of multiple TRAMs to make creative "leaps".    MINSTREL's storytelling process is based upon a model of author-level problem-solving. In addition to a process model of author-level problem-solving, MINSTREL implements four important classes of author-level goals and plans: (1) Thematic, (2) Dramatic, (3) Consistency, and (4) Presentation. MINSTREL uses these goals and plans to tell a number of short stories in the King Arthur domain.    MINSTREL is a computational model of the cognitive processes of storytelling and creativity. MINSTREL (1) describes a process model of storytelling, (2) identifies important storytelling goals and plans, (3) identifies fundamental storytelling processes, (4) describes a process model of creativity, (5) explains how a problem-solver can find and adapt old knowledge to create new solutions, (6) identifies useful creativity heuristics, (7) explains creative "leaps", (8) explains the relation of creativity to problem-solving, (9) describes the relationship between memory and creativity, and (10) integrates creativity into a larger cognitive model.},

	abstract = {We propose a methodology for a novel type of discourse annotation whose model is tuned to the analysis of a text as narrative. This is intended to be the basis of a story bank resource that would facilitate the automatic analysis of narrative structure and content. The methodology calls for annotators to construct propositions that approximate a reference text, by selecting predicates and arguments from among controlled vocabularies drawn from resources such as WordNet and VerbNet. Annotators then integrate the propositions into a conceptual graph that maps out the entire discourse; the edges represent temporal, causal and other relationships at the level of story content. Because annotators must identify the recurring objects and themes that appear in the text, they also perform coreference resolution and word sense disambiguation as they encode propositions. We describe a collection experiment and a method for determining inter-annotator agreement when multiple annotators encode the same short story. Finally, we describe ongoing work toward extending the method to integrate the annotators interpretations of character agency (the goals, plans and beliefs that are relevant, yet not explictly stated in the text).},

	abstract = {In Mixed-Initiative Co-Creative tools, the human is mostly in control of what will and can be created, delegating the AI to a more suggestive role instead of a colleague in the co-creative process. Allowing more control and agency for the AI might be an interesting path in co-creative scenarios where AI could direct and take more initiative within the co-creative task. However, the relationship between AI and human designers in creative processes is delicate, as adjusting the initiative or agency of the AI can negatively affect the user experience. In this paper, different degrees of agency for the AI are explored within the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) to further understand MI-CC tools. A user study was performed using EDD with three varying degrees of AI agency. The study highlighted elements of frustration that the human designer experiences when using the tool and the behavior in the AI that led to possible strains on the relationship. The paper concludes with the identified issues and possible solutions and suggested further research.},

	abstract = {In interactive machine learning, human users and learning algorithms work together in order to solve challenging learning problems, e.g. with limited or no annotated data or trust issues. As annotating data can be costly, it is important to minimize the amount of annotated data needed for training while still getting a high classification accuracy. This is done by attempting to select the most informative data instances for training, where the amount of instances is limited by a labelling budget. In an online learning setting, the decision of whether or not to select an instance for labelling has to be done on-the-fly, as the data arrives in a sequential order and is only valid for a limited time period. We present a taxonomy of interactive online machine learning strategies. An interactive learning strategy determines which instances to label in an unlabelled dataset. In the taxonomy we differentiate between interactive learning strategies when the computer controls the learning process (active learning) and those when human users control the learning process (machine teaching). We then make a distinction between what triggers the learning: active learning could be triggered by uncertainty, time, or randomly, whereas machine teaching could be triggered by errors, state changes, time, or factors related to the user. We also illustrate the taxonomy by implementing versions of the different strategies and performing experiments on a benchmark dataset as well as on a synthetically generated dataset. The results show that the choice of interactive learning strategy affects performance, especially in the beginning of the online learning process, when there is a limited amount of labelled data.},

The study involved systematically generating core dimensions of perceived story quality and addressing whether (a) lay-raters of different ages and genders evaluate story quality consistently and (b) multiple dimensions of story quality form a general factor (i.e., an index). Sixteen lay-raters judged 129 autobiographical and fictional stories. Analyses show that young and older men and women lay-raters judged story quality consistently (i.e., share an implicit theory) and that quality ratings form a unitary factor. This structure holds for both types of stories and is maintained across age and gender. The discussion focuses on the scope and limitations of the developed preliminary Perceived Story Quality Index.},

Through a systematic survey of neural network games (n = 38), we identified the dominant interaction metaphors and AI interaction patterns in these games. In addition, we applied existing human-AI interaction guidelines to further shed light on player-AI interaction in the context of AI-infused systems. Our core finding is that AI as play can expand current notions of human-AI interaction, which are predominantly productivity-based. In particular, our work suggests that game and UX designers should consider flow to structure the learning curve of human-AI interaction, incorporate discovery-based learning to play around with the AI and observe the consequences, and offer users an invitation to play to explore new forms of human-AI interaction.},

In this paper we suggest that current methods of evaluating Quality Diversity algorithm performance do not properly account for a decision maker's preference in a continuous descriptor space and suggest three approaches that attempt to capture the real-world trade-off between a solution's objective performance and distance from a desired set of target descriptors.In this paper we propose a randomised metric, a process of Monte-Carlo sampling of n target points in descriptor space and a small number of random weights that represent different tolerances for mis-specification in a solution's descriptor values. This sampling allows us to simulate the requirements of all possible combinations of target-tolerance pairs and, by taking sufficient samples, estimate average performance.We go on to formulate three simple methods for comparing average performance of algorithms; Continuous Quality Diversity score (CQD) and Hypervolume of the objective/distance Pareto front. We show that these measures are simple to implement and robust measures of performance without introducing artificial discretisation of the descriptor space.},

	abstract = {Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are a recent family of optimization algorithms that search for a large set of diverse but high-performing solutions. In some specific situations, they can solve multiple tasks at once. For instance, they can find the joint positions required for a robotic arm to reach a set of points, which can also be solved by running a classic optimizer for each target point. However, they cannot solve multiple tasks when the fitness needs to be evaluated independently for each task (e.g., optimizing policies to grasp many different objects). In this paper, we propose an extension of the MAP-Elites algorithm, called Multi-task MAP-Elites, that solves multiple tasks when the fitness function depends on the task. We evaluate it on a simulated parametrized planar arm (10-dimensional search space; 5000 tasks) and on a simulated 6-legged robot with legs of different lengths (36-dimensional search space; 2000 tasks). The results show that in both cases our algorithm outperforms the optimization of each task separately with the CMA-ES algorithm.},

	abstract = {Several works have demonstrated the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for generating levels in the style of existing games and blending levels across different games. Further, quality-diversity (QD) algorithms have also become popular for generating varied game content by using evolution to explore a search space while focusing on both variety and quality. To reap the benefits of both these approaches, we present a level generation and game blending approach that combines the use of VAEs and QD algorithms. Specifically, we train VAEs on game levels and run the MAP-Elites QD algorithm using the learned latent space of the VAE as the search space. The latent space captures the properties of the games whose levels we want to generate and blend, while MAP-Elites searches this latent space to find a diverse set of levels optimizing a given objective such as playability. We test our method using models for 5 different platformer games as well as a blended domain spanning 3 of these games. We refer to using MAP-Elites for blending as Blend-Elites. Our results show that MAP-Elites in conjunction with VAEs enables the generation of a diverse set of playable levels not just for each individual game but also for the blended domain while illuminating game-specific regions of the blended latent space.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced Intelligent Trial and Error algorithm (IT\&amp;E) both improves the ability to automatically generate controllers that transfer to real robots, and enables robots to creatively adapt to damage in less than 2 minutes. A key component of IT\&amp;E is a new evolutionary algorithm called MAP-Elites, which creates a behavior-performance map that is provided as a set of "creative" ideas to an online learning algorithm. To date, all experiments with MAP-Elites have been performed with a directly encoded list of parameters: it is therefore unknown how MAP-Elites would behave with more advanced encodings, like HyperNeat and SUPG. In addition, because we ultimately want robots that respond to their environments via sensors, we investigate the ability of MAP-Elites to evolve closed-loop controllers, which are more complicated, but also more powerful. Our results show that the encoding critically impacts the quality of the results of MAP-Elites, and that the differences are likely linked to the locality of the encoding (the likelihood of generating a similar behavior after a single mutation). Overall, these results improve our understanding of both the dynamics of the MAP-Elites algorithm and how to best harness MAP-Elites to evolve effective and adaptable robotic controllers.},

It builds on the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) system, which originally explored learning and environment generation for bipedal walkers, and adapts it to games in the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) system. Previous work showed that by co-evolving levels and neural network policies, levels could be found for which successful policies could not be created via optimization alone. Studied in the realm of Artificial Life as a potentially open-ended alternative to gradient-based fitness, minimal criteria (MC)-based selection helps foster diversity in evolutionary populations. The main question addressed by this paper is how the open-ended learning actually works, focusing in particular on the role of transfer of policies from one evolutionary branch ("species") to another. We analyze the dynamics of the system through creating phylogenetic trees, analyzing evolutionary trajectories of policies, and temporally breaking down transfers according to species type. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the minimal criterion on generated level diversity and inter-species transfer. The most insightful finding is that inter-species transfer, while rare, is crucial to the system's success.},

While GAN generated levels are stylistically similar to human-authored examples, human designers often want to explore the generative design space of GANs to extract interesting levels. However, human designers find latent vectors opaque and would rather explore along dimensions the designer specifies, such as number of enemies or obstacles. We propose using state-of-the-art quality diversity algorithms designed to optimize continuous spaces, i.e. MAP-Elites with a directional variation operator and Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites, to efficiently explore the latent space of a GAN to extract levels that vary across a set of specified gameplay measures. In the benchmark domain of Super Mario Bros, we demonstrate how designers may specify gameplay measures to our system and extract high-quality (playable) levels with a diverse range of level mechanics, while still maintaining stylistic similarity to human authored examples. An online user study shows how the different mechanics of the automatically generated levels affect subjective ratings of their perceived difficulty and appearance.},

We propose assisting MAP-Elites with a deep surrogate model trained online to predict game outcomes with respect to candidate decks. MAP-Elites discovers a diverse dataset to improve the surrogate model accuracy while the surrogate model helps guide MAP-Elites towards promising new content. In a Hearthstone deck-building case study, we show that our approach improves the sample efficiency of MAP-Elites and outperforms a model trained offline with random decks, as well as a linear surrogate model baseline, setting a new state-of-the-art for quality diversity approaches in automated Hearthstone deckbuilding.

	abstract = {We consider multi-solution optimization and generative models for the generation of diverse artifacts and the discovery of novel solutions. In cases where the domain's factors of variation are unknown or too complex to encode manually, generative models can provide a learned latent space to approximate these factors. When used as a search space, however, the range and diversity of possible outputs are limited to the expressivity and generative capabilities of the learned model. We compare the output diversity of a quality diversity evolutionary search performed in two different search spaces: 1) a predefined parameterized space and 2) the latent space of a variational autoencoder model. We find that the search on an explicit parametric encoding creates more diverse artifact sets than searching the latent space. A learned model is better at interpolating between known data points than at extrapolating or expanding towards unseen examples. We recommend using a generative model's latent space primarily to measure similarity between artifacts rather than for search and generation. Whenever a parametric encoding is obtainable, it should be preferred over a learned representation as it produces a higher diversity of solutions.},

These require the AI to deal with large action spaces, long-term planning and partial observability, among other well-known factors that make decision-making a hard problem. On top of this, achieving distinct play-styles using a general algorithm without reducing playing strength is not trivial. In this paper, we propose Portfolio Monte Carlo Tree Search with Progressive Unpruning for playing a turn-based strategy game (Tribes) and show how it can be parameterized so a quality-diversity algorithm (MAP-Elites) is used to achieve different play-styles while keeping a competitive level of play. Our results show that this algorithm is capable of achieving these goals even for an extensive collection of game levels beyond those used for training.},

In this work, we introduce Relevance-guided Unsupervised Discovery of Abilities; a Quality-Diversity algorithm that autonomously finds a behavioural characterisation tailored to the task at hand. In particular, our method introduces a custom diversity metric that leads to higher densities of solutions near the areas of interest in the learnt behavioural descriptor space. We evaluate our approach on a simulated robotic environment, where the robot has to autonomously discover its abilities based on its full sensory data. We evaluated the algorithms on three tasks: navigation to random targets, moving forward with a high velocity, and performing half-rolls. The experimental results show that our method manages to discover collections of solutions that are not only diverse, but also well-adapted to the considered downstream task.},

QD algorithms have been proposed to search for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions instead of a single set of local optima. Searching for diversity was shown to be useful in many industrial and robotics applications. On the other hand, most real-life problems exhibit several potentially conflicting objectives to be optimized. Hence being able to optimize for multiple objectives with an appropriate technique while searching for diversity is important to many fields. Here, we propose an extension of the map-elites algorithm in the multi-objective setting: Multi-Objective map-elites (mome). Namely, it combines the diversity inherited from the map-elites grid algorithm with the strength of multi-objective optimizations by filling each cell with a Pareto Front. As such, it allows to extract diverse solutions in the descriptor space while exploring different compromises between objectives. We evaluate our method on several tasks, from standard optimization problems to robotics simulations. Our experimental evaluation shows the ability of mome to provide diverse solutions while providing global performances similar to standard multi-objective algorithms.},

Among those algorithms, the recently introduced Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME) algorithm proposes the concept of emitters, which uses a predefined heuristic to drive the algorithm's exploration. This algorithm was shown to outperform MAP-Elites, a popular QD algorithm that has demonstrated promising results in numerous applications. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Emitter MAP-Elites (ME-MAP-Elites), an algorithm that directly extends CMA-ME and improves its quality, diversity and data efficiency. It leverages the diversity of a heterogeneous set of emitters, in which each emitter type improves the optimisation process in different ways. A bandit algorithm dynamically finds the best selection of emitters depending on the current situation. We evaluate the performance of ME-MAP-Elites on six tasks, ranging from standard optimisation problems (in 100 dimensions) to complex locomotion tasks in robotics. Our comparisons against CMA-ME and MAP-Elites show that ME-MAP-Elites is faster at providing collections of solutions that are significantly more diverse and higher performing. Moreover, in cases where no fruitful synergy can be found between the different emitters, ME-MAP-Elites is equivalent to the best of the compared algorithms.},

	abstract = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: Artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes, uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This article is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

This approach is particularly promising for learning behavioral repertoires in robotics, as such a diversity of behaviors enables robots to be more versatile and resilient. However, these algorithms require the user to manually define behavioral descriptors, which is used to determine whether two solutions are different or similar. The choice of a behavioral descriptor is crucial, as it completely changes the solution types that the algorithm derives. In this paper, we introduce a new method to automatically define this descriptor by combining Quality-Diversity algorithms with unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithms. This approach enables robots to autonomously discover the range of their capabilities while interacting with their environment. The results from two experimental scenarios demonstrate that robot can autonomously discover a large range of possible behaviors, without any prior knowledge about their morphology and environment. Furthermore, these behaviors are deemed to be similar to hand-crafted solutions that uses domain knowledge and significantly more diverse than when using existing unsupervised methods.},

	abstract = {Creating open-ended algorithms, which generate their own never-ending stream of novel and appropriately challenging learning opportunities, could help to automate and accelerate progress in machine learning. A recent step in this direction is the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET), an algorithm that generates and solves its own challenges, and allows solutions to goal-switch between challenges to avoid local optima. However, the original POET was unable to demonstrate its full creative potential because of limitations of the algorithm itself and because of external issues including a limited problem space and lack of a universal progress measure. Importantly, both limitations pose impediments not only for POET, but for the pursuit of open-endedness in general. Here we introduce and empirically validate two new innovations to the original algorithm, as well as two external innovations designed to help elucidate its full potential. Together, these four advances enable the most open-ended algorithmic demonstration to date. The algorithmic innovations are (1) a domain-general measure of how meaningfully novel new challenges are, enabling the system to potentially create and solve interesting challenges endlessly, and (2) an efficient heuristic for determining when agents should goal-switch from one problem to another (helping open-ended search better scale). Outside the algorithm itself, to enable a more definitive demonstration of open-endedness, we introduce (3) a novel, more flexible way to encode environmental challenges, and (4) a generic measure of the extent to which a system continues to exhibit open-ended innovation. Enhanced POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved through other means.},

Training can then be viewed as a quality diversity (QD) optimization problem, where we search for a collection of performant policies that are diverse with respect to quantified behavior. Recent work shows that differentiable quality diversity (DQD) algorithms greatly accelerate QD optimization when exact gradients are available. However, agent policies typically assume that the environment is not differentiable. To apply DQD algorithms to training agent policies, we must approximate gradients for performance and behavior. We propose two variants of the current state-of-the-art DQD algorithm that compute gradients via approximation methods common in reinforcement learning (RL). We evaluate our approach on four simulated locomotion tasks. One variant achieves results comparable to the current state-of-the-art in combining QD and RL, while the other performs comparably in two locomotion tasks. These results provide insight into the limitations of current DQD algorithms in domains where gradients must be approximated. Source code is available at https://github.com/icaros-usc/dqd-rl},

One way to address this would be to approach narrative design in a more abstract layer, such as narrative structures. This paper presents Story Designer, a mixed-initiative co-creative narrative structure tool built on top of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) that uses tropes, narrative conventions found across many media types, to design these structures. Story Designer uses tropes as building blocks for narrative designers to compose complete narrative structures by interconnecting them in graph structures called narrative graphs. Our mixed-initiative approach lets designers manually create their narrative graphs and feeds an underlying evolutionary algorithm with those, creating quality-diverse suggestions using MAP-Elites. Suggestions are visually represented for designers to compare and evaluate and can then be incorporated into the design for further manual editions. At the same time, we use the levels designed within EDD as constraints for the narrative structure, intertwining both level design and narrative. We evaluate the impact of these constraints and the system's adaptability and expressiveness, resulting in a potential tool to create narrative structures combining level design aspects with narrative.},

However, endeavors toward creativity and innovation are bounded by constraints such as rules and regulations, deadlines, and scarce resources. The effect of constraints on creativity and innovation has attracted substantial interest across the fields of strategic management, entrepreneurship, industrial organization, technology and operations management, organizational behavior, and marketing. Research in these fields has focused on various constraints that trigger distinct mediating mechanisms but is fragmented and yields conflicting findings. We develop a taxonomy of constraints and mediating mechanisms and provide an integrative synthesis that explains how constraints affect creativity and innovation. Our review thus facilitates cross-disciplinary learning and sets the stage for further theoretical development.},

Information games are a type of mystery game in which the player is tasked with gathering knowledge and developing an understanding of an event or system. Their reliance on player knowledge leaves them vulnerable to spoilers and hard to replay. In this paper we introduce the notion of a generative forensics game, a subgenre of information games that challenge the player to understand the output of a generative system, and present two examples.},

	abstract = {Game generation systems perform automated, intelligent design of games (i.e. videogames, boardgames), reasoning about both the abstract rule system of the game and the visual realization of these rules. Although, as an instance of the problem of creative design, game generation shares some common research themes with other creative AI systems such as story and art generators, game generation extends such work by having to reason about dynamic, playable artifacts. Like AI work on creativity in other domains, work on game generation sheds light on the human game design process, offering opportunities to make explicit the tacit knowledge involved in game design and test game design theories. Finally, game generation enables new game genres which are radically customized to specific players or situations; notable examples are cell phone games customized for particular users and newsgames providing commentary on current events. We describe an approach to formalizing game mechanics and generating games using those mechanics, using WordNet and ConceptNet to assist in performing common-sense reasoning about game verbs and nouns. Finally, we demonstrate and describe in detail a prototype that designs micro-games in the style of Nintendo's WarioWare series.},

	abstract = {How can progress in machine learning and reinforcement learning be automated to generate its own never-ending curriculum of challenges without human intervention? The recent emergence of quality diversity (QD) algorithms offers a glimpse of the potential for such continual open-ended invention. For example, novelty search showcases the benefits of explicit novelty pressure, MAP-Elites and Innovation Engines highlight the advantage of explicit elitism within niches in an otherwise divergent process, and minimal criterion coevolution (MCC) reveals that problems and solutions can coevolve divergently. The Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm introduced in this paper combines these principles to produce a practical approach to generating an endless progression of diverse and increasingly challenging environments while at the same time explicitly optimizing their solutions. An intriguing implication is the opportunity to transfer solutions among environments, reflecting the view that innovation is a circuitous and unpredictable process. POET is tested in a 2-D obstacles course domain, where it generates diverse and sophisticated behaviors that create and solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved by direct optimization, or by a direct-path curriculum-building control algorithm. We hope that POET will inspire a new push towards open-ended discovery across many domains.},

From how science is funded, to improving how children are educated – and nearly everything in-between – our society has become obsessed with a seductive illusion: that greatness results from doggedly measuring improvement in the relentless pursuit of an ambitious goal. In Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned, Stanley and Lehman begin with a surprising scientific discovery in artificial intelligence that leads ultimately to the conclusion that the objective obsession has gone too far. They make the case that great achievement can't be bottled up into mechanical metrics; that innovation is not driven by narrowly focused heroic effort; and that we would be wiser (and the outcomes better) if instead we whole-heartedly embraced serendipitous discovery and playful creativity. Controversial at its heart, yet refreshingly provocative, this book challenges readers to consider life without a destination and discovery without a compass.},

As an important means for conveying the game's story, quests dictate the setting and contents of levels. Levels provide challenges for the player to overcome in the service of completing quests, and their structure can invite the inclusion of certain kinds of quests. This paper presents an analysis of design patterns present in existing RPGs that aims to better understand such relationships. These patterns identify common design practices for quests and levels at many different levels of granularity.},

	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an emerging form of indirect encoding. The GAN is trained to induce a latent space on training data, and a real-valued evolutionary algorithm can search that latent space. Such Latent Variable Evolution (LVE) has recently been applied to game levels. However, it is hard for objective scores to capture level features that are appealing to players. Therefore, this paper introduces a tool for interactive LVE of tile-based levels for games. The tool also allows for direct exploration of the latent dimensions, and allows users to play discovered levels. The tool works for a variety of GAN models trained for both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, and is easily generalizable to other games. A user study shows that both the evolution and latent space exploration features are appreciated, with a slight preference for direct exploration, but combining these features allows users to discover even better levels. User feedback also indicates how this system could eventually grow into a commercial design tool, with the addition of a few enhancements.},

	abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG) refers to the practice of generating game content, such as levels, quests or characters, algorithmically. Motivated by the need to make games replayable, as well as to reduce authoring burden and enable particular aesthetics, many PCG methods have been devised. At the same time that researchers are adapting methods from machine learning (ML) to PCG problems, the ML community has become more interested in PCG-inspired methods. One reason for this development is that ML algorithms often only work for a particular version of a particular task with particular initial parameters. In response, researchers have begun exploring randomization of problem parameters to counteract such overfitting and to allow trained policies to more easily transfer from one environment to another, such as from a simulated robot to a robot in the real world. Here we review existing work on PCG, its overlap with current efforts in ML, and promising new research directions such as procedurally generated learning environments. Although originating in games, we believe PCG algorithms are critical to creating more general machine intelligence.},

	abstract = {While evolutionary computation and evolutionary robotics take inspiration from nature, they have long focused mainly on problems of performance optimization. Yet, evolution in nature can be interpreted as more nuanced than a process of simple optimization. In particular, natural evolution is a divergent search that optimizes locally within each niche as it simultaneously diversifies. This tendency to discover both quality and diversity at the same time differs from many of the conventional algorithms of machine learning, and also thereby suggests a different foundation for inferring the approach of greatest potential for evolutionary algorithms. In fact, several recent evolutionary algorithms called quality diversity (QD) algorithms (e.g., novelty search with local competition and MAP-Elites) have drawn inspiration from this more nuanced view, aiming to fill a space of possibilities with the best possible example of each type of achievable behavior. The result is a new class of algorithms that return an archive of diverse, high-quality behaviors in a single run. The aim in this paper is to study the application of QD algorithms in challenging environments (in particular complex mazes) to establish their best practices for ambitious domains in the future. In addition to providing insight into cases when QD succeeds and fails, a new approach is investigated that hybridizes multiple views of behaviors (called behavior characterizations) in the same run, which succeeds in overcoming some of the challenges associated with searching for QD with respect to a behavior characterization that is not necessarily sufficient for generating both quality and diversity at the same time.},

We present a testbed game tailored towards this end, in which a player competes against an agent with a frustration model based on theory. We collect gameplay data, an annotated ground truth about the player's appraisal of the agent's frustration, and apply face recognition to estimate the player's emotional state. We examine the collected data through correlation analysis and predictive machine learning models, and find that the player's observable emotions are not correlated highly with the perceived frustration of the agent. This suggests that our subject's ToM is a cognitive process based on the gameplay context. Our predictive models—using ranking support vector machines—corroborate these results, yielding moderately accurate predictors of players' ToM.},

From users' responses collected from an online gallery of all icons drawn with Iconoscope, we collect a corpus of over 500 icons which contain annotations of visual appeal. Several machine learning algorithms are tested for their ability to predict the appeal of an icon from its visual appearance and other properties. Findings show the impact of the representation on the model's accuracy and highlight how such a predictive model of quality can be applied to evaluate new icons (human-authored or generated).},

	abstract = {Though based on abstractions of nature, current evolutionary algorithms and artificial life models lack the drive to complexity characteristic of natural evolution. Thus this paper argues that the prevalent fitness-pressure-based abstraction does not capture how natural evolution discovers complexity. Alternatively, this paper proposes that natural evolution can be abstracted as a process that discovers many ways to express the same functionality. That is, all successful organisms must meet the same minimal criteria of survival and reproduction. This abstraction leads to the key idea in this paper: Searching for novel ways of meeting the same minimal criteria, which is an accelerated model of this new abstraction, may be an effective search algorithm. Thus the existing novelty search method, which rewards any new behavior, is extended to enforce minimal criteria. Such minimal criteria novelty search prunes the space of viable behaviors and may often be more efficient than the search for novelty alone. In fact, when compared to the raw search for novelty and traditional fitness-based search in the two maze navigation experiments in this paper, minimal criteria novelty search evolves solutions more consistently. It is possible that refining the evolutionary computation abstraction in this way may lead to solving more ambitious problems and evolving more complex artificial organisms.},

We consider the alternative storylets model of interactive narrative content, in which a game’s narrative is assembled from a database of discrete, reorderable narrative “chunks” or “modules” known as storylets. This paper represents a ﬁrst attempt to map out the design space of storylet-based narrative systems in games. We deﬁne the common elements of storyletbased systems; categorize such systems along several distinct dimensions; and survey implementations of such systems in existing games.},

Operationally, WFC implements a non-backtracking, greedy search method. This paper examines WFC as an instance of constraint solving methods.

These environments often take the form of games; with tasks ranging from simple board games, to competitive video games. We propose a new benchmark - Obstacle Tower: a high fidelity, 3D, 3rd person, procedurally generated environment 1. An agent playing Obstacle Tower must learn to solve both low-level control and high-level planning problems in tandem while learning from pixels and a sparse reward signal. Unlike other benchmarks such as the Arcade Learning Environment, evaluation of agent performance in Obstacle Tower is based on an agent's ability to perform well on unseen instances of the environment. In this paper we outline the environment and provide a set of baseline results produced by current state-of-the-art Deep RL methods as well as human players. These algorithms fail to produce agents capable of performing near human level.},

	abstract = {Hundreds of millions of people play computer games every day. For them, game content—from 3D objects to abstract puzzles—plays a major entertainment role. Manual labor has so far ensured that the quality and quantity of game content matched the demands of the playing community, but is facing new scalability challenges due to the exponential growth over the last decade of both the gamer population and the production costs. Procedural Content Generation for Games (PCG-G) may address these challenges by automating, or aiding in, game content generation. PCG-G is difficult, since the generator has to create the content, satisfy constraints imposed by the artist, and return interesting instances for gamers. Despite a large body of research focusing on PCG-G, particularly over the past decade, ours is the first comprehensive survey of the field of PCG-G. We first introduce a comprehensive, six-layered taxonomy of game content: bits, space, systems, scenarios, design, and derived. Second, we survey the methods used across the whole field of PCG-G from a large research body. Third, we map PCG-G methods to game content layers; it turns out that many of the methods used to generate game content from one layer can be used to generate content from another. We also survey the use of methods in practice, that is, in commercial or prototype games. Fourth and last, we discuss several directions for future research in PCG-G, which we believe deserve close attention in the near future.},

Our approach is implemented in GAME FORGE, a system that uses search-based optimization to find and render a novel game world configuration that supports a sequence of plot points plus play style preferences. Additionally, GAME FORGE supports execution of the game through reactive control of game world logic and non-player character behavior.},

Three layout creators and three furnishers are introduced in this paper, which can be combined in different ways in the two-step generative process for producing diverse dungeons levels. Layout creators generate the floors and walls of a level, while furnishers populate it with monsters, traps, and treasures. We test the generated levels on several expressivity measures, and in simulations with procedural persona agents.},

	abstract = {Choice-driven narratives, such as those created through systems like Twine, are a compelling form of interactive storytelling that have been around for many years. But as long as this form has existed, it has grappled with a persistent design problem: consistently presenting choices that feel both effective and relevant. Brute force can achieve the desired effect, but usually at the cost of prohibitively high authorial burden. To tackle this, generative approaches, such as Mawhorter’s Dunyazad, facilitate authoring procedural choice content for reuse and recombination. However, many such systems, while successful on technical levels, have yet to to be used to author large enough structures to support a full game, and require a high technical threshold for authors to use. To further development in this space, we present StoryAssembler, an open source generative narrative system that creates dynamic choice-driven narratives. It formed a critical part of Emma’s Journey, an interactive narrative game, the initial version of which was collaboratively authored by a team of six writers. In the course of the game’s creation, useful authoring patterns and design lessons were learned, as well as techniques that made the system approachable for first-time users.},

This method generates levels that are similar in style to the levels from which the original patterns were extracted, while still allowing for considerable variation in the geometry of the generated levels.

	abstract = {Automatically generating content for videogames has long been a staple of game development and the focus of much successful research. Such forays into content generation usually concern themselves with producing a specific game component, such as a level design. This has proven a rich and challenging area of research, but in focusing on creating separate parts of a larger game, we miss out on the most challenging and interesting aspects of game development. By expanding our scope to the automated design of entire games, we can investigate the relationship between the different creative tasks undertaken in game development, tackle the higher-level creative challenges of game design, and ultimately build systems capable of much greater novelty, surprise and quality in their output. This paper, the first in a series of two, describes two case studies in automating game design, proposing cooperative coevo- lution as a useful technique to use within systems that automate this process. We show how this technique allows essentially separate content generators to produce content that complements each other. We also describe systems that have used this to design games with subtle emergent effects. After introducing the technique and its technical basis in this paper, in the second paper in the series we discuss higher level issues in automated game design, such as potential overlap with computational creativity and the issue of evaluation.},

	abstract = {Procedural content generation is generally viewed as a means to an end – a tool employed by designers to overcome technical problems or achieve a particular design goal. When we move from generating single parts of games to automating the entirety of their design, however, we find ourselves facing a far wider and more interesting set of problems than mere generation. When the designer of a game is a piece of software, we face questions about what it means to be a designer, about Computational Creativity, and about how to assess the growth of these automated game designers and the value of their output. Answering these questions can lead to new ideas in how to generate content procedurally, and produce systems that can further the cutting edge of game design. This paper describes work done to take an automated game designer and advance it towards being a member of a creative community. We outline extensions made to the system to give it more autonomy and creative independence, in order to strengthen claims that the software is acting creatively. We describe and reflect upon the software’s participation in the games community, including entering two game development contests, and show the opportunities and difficulties of such engagement. We consider methods for evaluating automated game designers as creative entities, and underline the need for automated game design to be a major frontier in future games research.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have emphasized the merits of search processes that lack overarching objectives, instead promoting divergence by rewarding behavioral novelty. While this less objective search paradigm is more open-ended and divergent, it still differs significantly from nature's mechanism of divergence. Rather than measuring novelty explicitly nature is guided by a single, fundamental constraint: survive long enough to reproduce. Surprisingly, this simple constraint produces both complexity and diversity in a continual process unparalleled by any algorithm to date. Inspired by the relative simplicity of open-endedness in nature in comparison to recent non-objective algorithms, this paper investigates the extent to which interactions between two coevolving populations, both subject to their own constraint, or minimal criterion, can produce results that are both functional and diverse even without any behavior characterization or novelty archive. To test this new approach, a novel maze navigation domain is introduced wherein evolved agents must learn to navigate mazes whose structures are simultaneously coevolving and increasing in complexity. The result is a broad range of maze topologies and successful agent trajectories in a single run, thereby suggesting the viability of minimal criterion coevolution as a new approach to non-objective search and a step towards genuinely open-ended algorithms.},

These games are typically structured as puzzles or quests wherein the player must execute certain actions in a certain order to succeed. In this paper, we consider the problem of procedurally generating a quest, deﬁned as a series of actions required to progress towards a goal, in a textadventure game. Quest generation in text environments is challenging because they must be semantically coherent. We present and evaluate two quest generation techniques: (1) a Markov model, and (2) a neural generative model. We speciﬁcally look at generating quests about cooking and train our models on recipe data. We evaluate our techniques with human participant studies looking at perceived creativity and coherence.},

It discusses the merits of different types of generative grammars for each individual step in the process.

We describe Gemini, the first bidirectional game generation and analysis system. Gemini is able to take games as input, perform a proceduralist reading of them, and produce possible interpretations that the games might afford. By utilizing the declarative nature of Answer Set Programming (ASP), this analysis pathway opens up generation of games targeting specific interpretations and makes it possible to ensure the generated games are consistent with the desired reading. For Gemini, we developed a game specification language capable of expressing a larger domain of games than is possible with VGDL, the most widespread representation. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by generating games in a series of domains. These domains are based on prototypes hand-created by a team without knowledge of the constraints and capabilities of Gemini.},

	abstract = {Retaining premium players is key to the success of free-to-play games, but most of them do not start purchasing right after joining the game. By exploiting the exceptionally rich datasets recorded by modern video games—which provide information on the individual behavior of each and every player—survival analysis techniques can be used to predict what players are more likely to become paying (or even premium) users and when, both in terms of time and game level, the conversion will take place.Here we show that a traditional semi-parametric model (Cox regression), a random survival forest (RSF) technique and a method based on conditional inference survival ensembles all yield very promising results. However, the last approach has the advantage of being able to correct the inherent bias in RSF models by dividing the procedure into two steps: first selecting the best predictor to perform the splitting and then the best split point for that covariate.The proposed conditional inference survival ensembles method could be readily used in operational environments for early identification of premium players and the parts of the game that may prompt them to become paying users. Such knowledge would allow developers to induce their conversion and, more generally, to better understand the needs of their players and provide them with a personalized experience, thereby increasing their engagement and paving the way to higher monetization.},

	abstract = {The paper will explore how the landscape types and the quest types are used in various games, how they structure the gameplay, how they act as bones for the game-content (graphics, dialogue, sound) and how they sometimes form the base on which a story is imposed and related to the player. The question then becomes, how does the quest structure influence the story structure? How do the limitations of the quest combinations limit the kinds of story that are possible? How rich can the imposed story be, without breaking the gameplay? Are landscape and quest-structure the dominant factors in quest game design, to which the story-ambitions must defer? The main thesis of the paper is that if we understand the powerful but simple structure - the grammar of quests (how they work, how they are used) we can understand both the limits and the potential of these kinds of games.},

While Game AI was for a long time not very well recognized by the larger scientific community, it has established itself as a research area for developing and testing the most advanced forms of AI algorithms and articles covering advances in mastering video games such as StarCraft 2 and Quake III appear in the most prestigious journals. Because of the growth of the field, a single review cannot cover it completely. Therefore, we put a focus on important recent developments, including that advances in Game AI are starting to be extended to areas outside of games, such as robotics or the synthesis of chemicals. In this article, we review the algorithms and methods that have paved the way for these breakthroughs, report on the other important areas of Game AI research, and also point out exciting directions for the future of Game AI.},

	abstract = {Understanding player behavior is fundamental in game data science. Video games evolve as players interact with the game, so being able to foresee player experience would help to ensure a successful game development. In particular, game developers need to evaluate beforehand the impact of in-game events. Simulation optimization of these events is crucial to increase player engagement and maximize monetization. We present an experimental analysis of several methods to forecast game-related variables, with two main aims: to obtain accurate predictions of in-app purchases and playtime in an operational production environment, and to perform simulations of in-game events in order to maximize sales and playtime. Our ultimate purpose is to take a step towards the data-driven development of games. The results suggest that even though the performance of traditional approaches, such as ARIMA is still better, the outcomes of state-of-the-art techniques like deep learning are promising. Deep learning comes up as a well-suited general model that could be used to forecast a variety of time series with different dynamic behaviors.},

	abstract = {An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

	abstract = {An ambitious challenge in artificial life is to craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of well-adapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit. However, novelty search, a technique that explicitly rewards diverging, can potentially mitigate such convergence. Thus in this paper an existing creature evolution platform is extended with multi-objective search that balances drives for both novelty and performance. However, there are different ways to combine performance-driven search and novelty search. The suggested approach is to provide evolution with both a novelty objective that encourages diverse morphologies and a local competition objective that rewards individuals outperforming those most similar in morphology. The results in an experiment evolving locomoting virtual creatures show that novelty search with local competition discovers more functional morphological diversity within a single run than models with global competition, which are more predisposed to converge. The conclusions are that novelty search with local competition may complement recent advances in evolving virtual creatures and may in general be a principled approach to combining novelty search with pressure to achieve.},

[The author] interviewed more than 90 [people] who have changed the way people in their fields think and work to find out how creativity has been a force in their lives. [Building on his state of consciousness flow theory, the author] explores why creative people are often seen as selfish and arrogant (even though they are not) and reveals that the idea of the tortured genius is largely a myth. He argues that creativity needs to be cultivated not only in traditionally creative fields like sciences and arts, but also in business, government, and education. This book is not so much about the everyday "creativity" that we all experience but the kind of creativity of artists, scientists, and others that can transform our culture and the way we look at the world.

	abstract = {Novelty search is a recent algorithm geared toward exploring search spaces without regard to objectives. When the presence of constraints divides a search space into feasible space and infeasible space, interesting implications arise regarding how novelty search explores such spaces. This paper elaborates on the problem of constrained novelty search and proposes two novelty search algorithms which search within both the feasible and the infeasible space. Inspired by the FI-2pop genetic algorithm, both algorithms maintain and evolve two separate populations, one with feasible and one with infeasible individuals, while each population can use its own selection method. The proposed algorithms are applied to the problem of generating diverse but playable game levels, which is representative of the larger problem of procedural game content generation. Results show that the two-population constrained novelty search methods can create, under certain conditions, larger and more diverse sets of feasible game levels than current methods of novelty search, whether constrained or unconstrained. However, the best algorithm is contingent on the particularities of the search space and the genetic operators used. Additionally, the proposed enhancement of offspring boosting is shown to enhance performance in all cases of two-population novelty search.},

	abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings , i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

By greedily following the path of greatest fitness improvement, objective-based search overlooks and discards stepping stones which might be critical to solving the problem. Here, we hypothesize that Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are a better way to generate stepping stones than objective-based search: by maintaining a large set of solutions which are of high-quality, but phenotypically different, these algorithms collect promising stepping stones while protecting them in their own "ecological niche". To demonstrate the capabilities of QD we revisit the challenge of recreating images produced by user-driven evolution, a classic challenge which spurred work in novelty search and illustrated the limits of objective-based search. We show that QD far outperforms objective-based search in matching user-evolved images. Further, our results suggest some intriguing possibilities for leveraging the diversity of solutions created by QD.},

	abstract = {Procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML) is typically framed as the task of fitting a generative model to full-scale examples of a desired content distribution. This approach presents a fundamental tension: the more design effort expended to produce detailed training examples for shaping a generator, the lower the return on investment from applying PCGML in the first place. In response, we propose the use of discriminative models, which capture the validity of a design rather the distribution of the content, trained on positive and negative example design fragments. Through a modest modification of WaveFunctionCollapse, a commercially-adopted PCG approach that we characterize as using elementary machine learning, we demonstrate a new mode of control for learning-based generators. We demonstrate how an artist might craft a focused set of additional positive and negative design fragments by critique of the generator's previous outputs. This interaction mode bridges PCGML with mixed-initiative design assistance tools by working with a machine to define a space of valid designs rather than just one new design.},

We discuss here how we adapted and enhanced an evolutionary art approach for casual creation. Employing a fun-first methodology for the app design, we improved image production speed and the quality of randomly generated images. We further employed machine vision techniques for image categorisation and clustering, and designed a user interface for fast, fun image generation, adhering to numerous principles arising from the study of casual creators. We describe the implementation and experimentation performed during the first stage of development, and evaluate the app in terms of efficiency, image quality, feedback quality and the potential for users to have fun. We conclude with a description of how the app, which is destined for public release, will also be used as a research platform and as part of an art installation.},

Any form of computational narrative authoring is at some level always mixed-initiative, meaning that the processing capabilities of the computer are utilized with a varying degree to automate certain features of the authoring process. We structure this survey by focusing on two key components of stories, plot and space, and more speciﬁcally the degree to which these are either automated by the computer or authored manually. By examining the successes of existing research, we identify potential new research directions in the ﬁeld of computational narrative. We also identify the advantages of developing a standard model of narrative to allow for collaboration between plot and space automation techniques. This would likely beneﬁt the ﬁeld of automated space generation with the strengths in the ﬁeld of automated plot generation.},

Beyond linguistic features, the domain models take into consideration contextual evidence, including visual findings. We discuss key principles of conversational actions under uncertainty and the overall architecture of the system, highlighting the use of a hierarchy of Bayesian models at different levels of detail, the use of value of information to control question asking, and application of expected utility to control progression and backtracking in conversation.},

The eld is now in a state where there is a glut of content generators, each serving dierent purposes and using a variety of techniques. It is dicult to understand, quantitatively or qualitatively, what makes one generator dierent from another in terms of its output. To remedy this, we have conducted a large-scale comparative evaluation of level generators for the Mario AI Benchmark, a research-friendly clone of the classic platform game Super Mario Bros. In all, we compare the output of seven dierent level generators from the literature, based on dierent algorithmic methods, plus the levels from the original Super Mario Bros game. To compare them, we have dened six expressivity metrics, of which two are novel contributions in this paper. These metrics are shown to provide interestingly dierent characterizations of the level generators. The results presented in this paper, and the accompanying source code, is meant to become a benchmark against which to test new level generators and expressivity metrics.},

DeLeNoX proceeds in alternating phases of exploration and transformation. In the exploration phases, a version of novelty search augmented with constraint handling searches for maximally diverse artifacts using a given distance function. In the transformation phases, a deep learning autoencoder learns to compress the variation between the found artifacts into a lower-dimensional space. The newly trained encoder is then used as the basis for a new distance function, transforming the criteria for the next exploration phase. In the current paper, we apply DeLeNoX to the creation of spaceships suitable for use in two-dimensional arcade-style computer games, a representative problem in procedural content generation in games. We also situate DeLeNoX in relation to the distinction between exploratory and transformational creativity, and in relation to Schmidhuber's theory of creativity through the drive for compression progress.},

At times, they can even be argued to be ethically obligatory. Conversely, AI rebellion is largely seen as a dangerous, destructive prospect. With the increase of interest in collaborative human/AI environments in which synthetic agents play social roles or, at least, exhibit behavior with social and ethical implications, we believe that AI rebellion could have benefits similar to those of its counterpart in humans. We introduce a framework meant to help categorize and design Rebel Agents, discuss their social and ethical implications, and assess their potential benefits and the risks they may pose. We also present AI rebellion scenarios in two considerably different contexts (military unmanned vehicles and computational social creativity) that exemplify components of the framework.},

	abstract = {While the games industry is moving towards procedural content generation (PCG) with tools available under popular platforms such as Unreal, Unity or Houdini, and video game titles like No Man’s Sky and Horizon Zero Dawn taking advantage of PCG, the gap between academia and industry is as wide as it has ever been, in terms of communication and sharing methods. The authors have worked on both sides of this gap and in an effort to shorten it and increase the synergy between the two sectors have identified three design pillars for PCG using mixed-initiative interfaces. The three pillars are respect designer control, respect the creative process and respect existing work processes. Respecting designer control is about creating a tool that gives enough control to bring out the designer’s vision. Respecting the creative process concerns itself with having a feedback loop that is short enough, that the creative process is not disturbed. Respecting existing work processes means that a PCG tool should plug in easily to existing asset pipelines. As academics and communicators, it is surprising that publications often do not describe ways for developers to use our work or lack considerations for how a piece of work might fit into existing content pipelines.},

	abstract = {MAP-Elites has been successfully applied to the generation of game content and robot behaviors. However, its behavior and performance when interacted with in co-creative systems is underexplored. This paper analyzes the implications of synthetic interaction for the stability and adaptability of MAP-Elites in such scenarios. We use pre-recorded human-made level design sessions with the Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites (IC MAP-Elites). To analyze the effect of each edition step in the search space over time using different feature dimensions, we introduce Temporal Expressive Range Analysis (TERA). With TERAs, MAP-Elites is assessed in terms of its adaptability and stability to generate diverse and high-performing individuals. Our results show that interactivity, in the form of design edits and MAP-Elites adapting towards them, directs the search process to previously unexplored areas of the fitness landscape and points towards how this could improve and enrich the co-creative process with quality-diverse individuals.},

	abstract = {Today’s increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. Algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be inﬂuenced by prejudice, conﬂicts of interest, or fatigue. However, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. In this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric AI: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy.},

We introduce process aesthetics as an analytical lens through which to examine the motivations and values of different autotelic CSTs, including but not limited to casual creators. Based on this analysis, we then investigate a novel process aesthetic—reﬂection—for autotelic CSTs, present a set of autotelic CST design patterns intended to elicit reﬂection, and discuss three case studies of autotelic CSTs that make use of these design patterns.},

In this work, we tackle a comprehensive understanding of how the intersections of users, roles, interactions, and technologies form a design space for CSTs. We accomplish this by reviewing 111 art-creation CSTs from HCI and computing research and analyzing how diverse aspects of CSTs relate to each other. Our findings identify patterns for designing CSTs, which can give guidance to future CST designers. We also highlight under-explored types of CSTs within the HCI community, providing future directions that CST researchers can pursue given the current trajectory of technological advancement.

	abstract = {Technical developments in computer hardware and software now make it possible to introduce automation into virtually all aspects of human-machine systems. Given these technical capabilities, which system functions should be automated and to what extent? We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for making such choices. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},

One of the focuses of intelligent virtual agent research in general and story generation research in particular is how to make agents/characters more lifelike and compelling. However, one question that invariably comes up is: Is the generated story good? An easier question to tackle is whether a reader/viewer of a generated story perceives certain essential attributes such as causal coherence and character believability. Character believability is the perception that story world characters are acting according to their own beliefs, desires, and intentions. We present a novel procedure for objectively evaluating stories generated for multiple agents/characters with regard to character intentionality – an important aspect of character believability. The process transforms generated stories into a standardized model of story comprehension and then indirectly compares that representation to reader/viewer mental perceptions about the story. The procedure is illustrated by evaluating a narrative planning system, Fabulist.},

Interactive narratives exhibit features and characteristics from story telling or film and differ from more conventional software systems by being functionally more complex and by addressing a broader and wider audience of users. Interactive narratives include software systems like computer games or training and assessment systems. This paper provides a qualitative study of industrial design processes of interactive narratives based on interviews with two interactive narrative authors. The paper identifies major activities and products of the design process and illustrates how the activities are related. It is concluded that a number of prototypical narrative structures are commonly used to organize and design the narration. These narrative structures are presented and explained based on the study. A possible contradiction between “interaction” and “narrative” is discussed, and a solution, based on an object-oriented methodology combined with literary analysis, is suggested.},

We focus our work on inventing plan operators that are useful for contributing to suspenseful interactive stories, using suspense metrics that have been proposed in the literature.

Drawing on evaluation methodologies from cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and natural language processing, as well as techniques that have begun to emerge in the narrative technologies community, STORYEVAL consists of four complementary tools for evaluating both interactive and non-interactive narrative generation: Narrative Metrics, Cognitive-Affective Studies, Directorcentric Studies, and Extrinsic Narrative Evaluations.

The purpose of most story authoring is not to invent a new style or genre of story that will be accepted by the population but to invent a single narrative that is novel enough to be tellable. Computational story generation systems are more limited than human authors in the space of narratives that can be considered because it is often the case that story generation systems are constrained to operate within a fixed representation of the story world. These limitations can impact whether a story generation system is considered creative or not. In this paper, we describe a story planning system, Fabulist. Fabulist however is constrained by the world model input by the system user. We present two algorithms that enable story planning systems such as Fabulist to break outside the bounds of the initial world model in order to search a larger space of narratives.},

In the field of Interactive Digital Storytelling (IDS), integrating knowledge about dramatic situations is of great relevance in order to design improved systems that dynamically generate more narratively-relevant events.

We introduce a computational model that fills that gap by both describing dramatic situations visually and providing a quantitative measure for the interestingness of a plot. Using a corpus of 20 Aesop's fables, we compared the calculations resulting of the model with the assessments provided by 101 participants. Results suggest that our model works appropriately at least for stories characterized by a strong plot structure rather than their semantic content.},

Narrative generation systems seek to either automatically generate stories from scratch or, create stories from predeﬁned conditions. With the rise of machines as co-authors it is important to consider what the aﬀect is upon the cohesion of the narratives represented or created in this way. Typically, in existing work, this is limited to an analysis of the use of textual language within the narrative to communicate a coherent message. However we ﬁnd that beyond linguistic connections narrative elements are coherently bound together through other concepts and structures such as themes, genre, narrator, and style.

	abstract = {This work proposes an engine for the Creation Of Novel Adventure Narrative (CONAN), which is a procedural quest generator that uses a planning approach. The engine is tested on its ability to create quests, which are sets of actions that must be performed in order to achieve a certain goal. The engine takes in a world description represented as a set of facts, including characters, locations, and items, and generates quests according to the state of the world and the preferences of the characters in it. We evaluate quests through the classification of the motivations behind the quests. We also compare world descriptions of two different sizes. Compared to human structural quest classification, the current engine was found to be able to replicate the quest structures found in commercial video game quests.},

We argue that the restriction to CFGs is unnecessary and that the standard pattern-directed, nondeterministic control structures common to Prolog, definite-clause grammars, and many HTNs, support a superset of these capabilities while still being simple to implement. We describe Step, a generative text system for Unity games based on higher-order HTNs that so far as we can determine from published descriptions, generalizes this previous work. We then describe syntactic extensions to make Step more natural as a text-authoring language. Finally, we discuss how Step and similar systems can be implemented very compactly in modern mainstream programming languages.},

However, despite continued interest in emergent narrative approaches, there has been relatively little work in the area of story sifting to date, leaving it unclear how a story sifting system might best be implemented and what challenges are likely to be encountered in the course of implementing such a system. In this paper, we present Felt, a simple query language-based story sifter and rules-based simulation engine that aims to serve as a ﬁrst step toward answering these questions.

In this work, we use an existing rhythm improvisation system to explore how we can engender different co-creation experiences by varying the system’s co-creative behavior. In an exploratory study, the system’s co-creative behavior was varied by manipulating a single experimental control and used to engender co-creative experiences in rhythm duets. In one experimental condition, the system induced a sense of producing divergent material, inﬂuencing creative outcomes, and negotiating musical outcomes, three aspects that were consistent with group music creativity. These ﬁndings provide supportive evidence that the system’s parameter can be varied to systematically engender co-creative experiences distinct from creative support.},

Firstly, the framework aids collaboration between interdisciplinary speculators when imagining future scenarios about co-creative systems together.

By dialogue we mean both traditional language-based communication for explicit critique and persuasion (dialogue about creative artefacts) as well as a broader potentially non-linguistic notion of dialogue that emerges through the exchange of suggestions and changes (dialogue through creative artefacts). To capture this, we deﬁne DCAI as occurring when both system and user are able to inﬂuence each others’ creative objectives. The paper motivates our pursuit of dialogic interaction and provides some explanation of why we have deﬁned it through its impacts rather than its mechanism of action. We provide two analyses to support our argument: an exploration of a commercial creativity support tool that has an extensive vocabulary for describing artefacts abstractly but does not meet our definition of dialogic interaction, and a case study of a creative interaction between two human professionals that exhibits dialogic interaction throughout. For the latter we consider how studies of human-human co-creation can offer non-obvious design concepts that might be applied to co-creative DCAI systems.},

Fruitful co-creation requires a sustained ongoing interaction that can include discussions of ideas, comparisons to previous/other works, incremental improvements and revisions, etc. For these interactions, communication is an intrinsic factor. This means giving a voice to CC systems and enabling two-way communication channels between them and their users so that they can: explain their processes and decisions, support their ideas so that these are given serious consideration by their creative collaborators, and learn from these discussions to further improve their creative processes. For this, we propose a set of design principles for CC systems that aim at supporting greater cocreation and collaboration with their human collaborators.},

Besides being tedious and error-prone, this approach requires additional effort for each new game and level to be mapped. The results can still be hard for humans or computational systems to make use of, privileging visual appearance over semantic information. We describe a software system, Mappy, that produces a good approximation of a linked map of rooms given a Nintendo Entertainment System game program and a sequence of button inputs exploring its world. In addition to visual maps, Mappy outputs grids of tiles (and how they change over time), positions of non-tile objects, clusters of similar rooms that might in fact be the same room, and a set of links between these rooms. We believe this is a necessary step towards developing larger corpora of high-quality semantically-annotated maps for PCG via machine learning and other applications.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the conventional role of evolution in evolutionary computation (EC) as an optimization algorithm, a new class of evolutionary algorithms has emerged in recent years that instead aim to accumulate as diverse a collection of discoveries as possible, yet where each variant in the collection is as fit as it can be. Often applied in both neuroevolution and morphological evolution, these new quality diversity (QD) algorithms are particularly well-suited to evolution's inherent strengths, thereby offering a promising niche for EC within the broader field of machine learning. However, because QD algorithms are so new, until now no comprehensive study has yet attempted to systematically elucidate their relative strengths and weaknesses under different conditions. Taking a first step in this direction, this paper introduces a new benchmark domain designed specifically to compare and contrast QD algorithms. It then shows how the degree of alignment between the measure of quality and the behavior characterization (which is an essential component of all QD algorithms to date) impacts the ultimate performance of different such algorithms. The hope is that this initial study will help to stimulate interest in QD and begin to unify the disparate ideas in the area.},

	abstract = {We introduce the problem of content-based retrieval for moments in videogames. This new area for artificial intelligence in games exercises automated gameplay and visual understanding while making connections to information retrieval. We propose a number of techniques to discover the interesting moments in a game (crawling), show how to compress moments into an efficiently searchable structure (indexing), and recall those moments most relevant to a user-provided query (retrieving). We combine these ideas in a prototype visual search engine and compare it with commercial visual search engines. Searching within a corpus of moments from Super Nintendo Entertainment System games using query images extracted from YouTube videos, our prototype is able to identify moments that web-oriented search engines rarely see.},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

In each event, a piece of information (for example, a game challenge) is presented to the player, and the player responds to that information by executing proper in-game actions. Since different games have different systems and mechanics, it is difficult to analyze and compare game events across different games. In this paper, we propose an approach to measure the similarity between game events from different games quantitatively. This similarity information can then be used to transfer probabilistic models built for analyzing and generating game levels for one game to another game.},

Finally, we note how a user can set tasks for the program to achieve and how this affects the calculation of interestingness.

The automatic generation of quests and objectives is an interesting challenge since this can extend the lifetime of games such as in {\textbackslash}emphSkyrim, or can help create unique experiences such as in {\textbackslash}emphAI Dungeon. This work presents Questgram [Qg], a mixed-initiative prototype tool for creating quests using grammars combined in a mixed-initiative level design tool. We evaluated our tool quantitatively by assessing the generated quests and qualitatively through a small user study. Human designers evaluated the system by creating quests {\textbackslash}emphmanually, {\textbackslash}emphautomatically, and through {\textbackslash}emphmixed-initiative. Our results show the QuestGram's potential, which creates diverse, valid, and interesting quests using quest patterns. Likewise, it helps engage designers in the quest design process, fosters their creativity by inspiring them, and enhance the level generation facet of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer with steps towards intertwining both level and quest design.},

This approach can be used when few or no examples exist to train from, and the trained generator is very fast.

The planner has an author goal it must achieve, but every action taken by an agent must make sense according to that agent's individual intentions and limited, possibly wrong beliefs. This paper describes the implementation of Sabre, which supports a rich action syntax and imposes no arbitrary limit on the depth of theory of mind. We present a search procedure for generating plans that achieve the author goals while ensuring all agent actions are explained, and we report the system's performance on several narrative planning benchmark problems.},

CiF models characters with a complex set of traits, feelings, and relationships, who can form intents, take actions, relate to a shared cultural space, and remember and refer to past events. A set of authored rules encoding appropriate behavior within a speciﬁc story world allow these characters to select actions to take (and respond to actions by others) in a manner consistent with their own personal and social concerns as well as a shifting interpersonal context. Through the development and release of Prom Week, a complete game using CiF as its narrative engine, we show how the system successfully creates complex narratives that are unique for each player and directed by those players’ attempts to make progress towards story goals. We also show how CiF continues to be used in several in-progress interactive experiences (Mismanor and IMMERSE), speaking to the utility and ﬂexibility of its design.},

Procedural content generation has been used to aid with increasing variance in game play, leading to a higher replay value. However, games that feature information that must be obtained by the player present the additional challenge of tracking the player’s knowledge and ensuring that it is possible for them to ﬁnish the game. In this paper we present a detective game with procedurally generated characters that pursue a range of goals, including one that commits a murder. The player’s role is to solve the crime by collecting evidence from the actual game world as well as by interrogating the characters. Even though some of the characters might be inclined to hide evidence, our system guarantees that the player is always able to solve the murder case. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system we present a short example game that we have implemented using our techniques.},

The parts of the generated narratives are then presented to a player whose task it is to ﬁgure out who the murderer in this story could have been. Rather than aiming to replace highly authored narratives, this project generates puzzles, which may contain emerging arcs of a story as perceived by the player. While we found that even a simple rule set can create stories that are interesting to reason about, we expect that this type of system is ﬂexible enough to create considerably more engaging stories if enough time is invested in authoring more complex rule sets.},

In this article we investigate what may draw researchers towards this genre, and then disseminate why the very properties that make murder mysteries such an appealing target also make it a particularly challenging domain. For the apparent rigid scaffolding structure provided by the genre, we discuss its ﬂexibility; for the apparent hard grounding in logic we illuminate the deﬁciency of such; and for the seemingly clear communication maxims prescribed by written “rules” for the genre we explore which ones must be broken. Our goal is to show the actual scale of the difﬁculty of the problem, and which challenges have yet to be addressed.

Unlike most previous coherence evaluation studies, we address specific linguistic devices beyond sentence order perturbations, allowing for a more fine-grained analysis of what constitutes coherence and what neural models trained on a language modelling objective do encode. Extending the targeted evaluation paradigm for neural language models (Marvin and Linzen, 2018) to phenomena beyond syntax, we show that this paradigm is equally suited to evaluate linguistic qualities that contribute to the notion of coherence.},

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Agents are given sets of permitted actions and obligations to fulﬁl based on their and the story’s current situation. However, a way to describe stories in terms of social norms is needed.

This includes designing at a high level different elements of the film; these high-level elements are called tropes when they become patterns. The present paper proposes and evaluates a methodology to automatically synthesize sets of tropes in a way that they maximize the potential rating of a film that conforms to them. We use machine learning to create a surrogate model that maps film ratings from tropes, trained with the data extracted and processed from huge film databases in Internet, and then we use a genetic algorithm that uses that surrogate model as evaluator to optimize the combination of tropes in a film. In order to evaluate the methodology, we analyse the nature of the tropes and their distributions in existing films, the performance of the models and the quality of the sets of tropes synthesized. The results of this proof of concept show that the methodology works and is able to build sets of tropes that maximize the rating and that these sets are genuine. The work has revealed that the methodology and tools developed are directly suitable for assisting in the plots generation as an authoring tool and, ultimately, for supporting the automatic generation of stories, for example, in massively populated videogames.},

The rest of the cast consists of discrete computer characters. Our resolution method takes into account the motives of the user character to decide on: (i) the outcome of all character actions and (ii) the presentation sequence for these outcomes. The decision process is based on the current story context. In addition, it addresses the need to avoid ambiguities, to preserve consistency and to create suspense during the end.

	abstract = {An intriguing phenomenon in human storytelling – inexhaustible source of inspiration for digital storytelling – is our ability to still recognize a story that the narrator has felt free to change to a considerable extent. However, observing how folktales have appeared and disseminated through different countries along the centuries, we may notice that our favorite stories have evolved no less dramatically in the course of the oral storytelling tradition. In this paper, taking Little Red Riding Hood as example, we review a small number of variants of this universally cherished story, in an attempt to understand how variants emerge. Our study is founded on the classiﬁcation of types and motifs contained in the Index of Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson, and examines the hypothesis that variants are often the consequence of type interactions, which we propose to characterize in terms of semiotic relations associated with the socalled four master tropes. The paper presents our analysis of the variant-formation phenomenon and describes the implementation of a computational system capable of generating new variants by applying the proposed semiotic relations.},

            In this article, we introduce the concept of narrative act which denotes a meta-action—an action on an action—that contributes to the narrative sequence. Narrative acts have been often described in narrative theories, in particular within structuralism, but never systematically studied. Examples of narrative acts include Ask, Order, or Forbid. Moreover, in the interactive digital narrative (IDN) field, such narrative acts may take a central role when they are used as building blocks in combinatorial generative systems. Therefore, this article proposes a unique effort to establish an extensive catalog of such narrative acts, with the view that this catalog is a work in progress by definition since it targets the IDN domain, which consists of a very limited corpus of works. It is, however, a necessary step toward a more theoretical approach of narrative acts in IDN. The catalog contains more than 200 narrative acts, for which a number of features have been collected. Among those is the source of the act, either a narrative or speech act theory or a theoretical work or an implemented system. A general three-level taxonomy is also proposed, associated with an interactive visualization tool available online, allowing researchers and creative authors to consult and expand the catalog.},

We sketch out, in general abstract terms, what goes on when a potentially creative program is constructed and run, and list some of the relationships (for example, between input and output) which might contribute to a decision about creativity. Speciﬁcally, we list a number of criteria which might indicate interesting properties of a program’s behaviour, from the perspective of possible creativity.

Interactive narrative systems tell stories in a virtual world in which the user is an interactive participant. Since the behaviors the user performs in the virtual world can affect the way in which a storyline unfolds, interactive narrative systems often use a branching story structure where non-interactive story presentations are interleaved with user decision points. An alternative approach – narrative mediation – represents story as a linear progression of events with anticipated user actions and system-controlled agent actions together in a partially-ordered plan. For every possible way the user can violate the story plan, an alternative story plan is generated. If narrative mediation is powerful enough to express the same interactive stories as systems that use branching story structures, then linear narrative generation techniques can be applied to interactive narrative generation with the use of narrative mediation. This paper sketches out a proof that narrative mediation is at least as powerful as acyclic branching story structures.},

Plot twists are characterized by three distinct but intimately intertwined temporal segments and their corresponding functions, which are explained by this model. The objective of this article is to explore how cognitive-emotional interactions shape the aesthetic viewing experience and to identify how that experience relates to shows’ artistic qualities. Game of Thrones (S01 and S03), Homeland (S01), and Westworld (S01) will be used as test cases.

In this position paper, we present a proposal for the fundamental unit of narrative, which we call the narreme. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we present the structure of the narreme, which encodes the state of the narrative, not the state of the world. Second, we present the ways narremes can be combined, which gives rise to the structure of the narrative itself. These combinations have special properties which account for the causal, temporal and intentional relationships between the events that make up a narrative. Lastly, we present an interpretation of common narrative tasks within the context of the narreme.},

A trope is a recurring storytelling device or pattern, or sometimes a meta-element, used by the authors to express ideas that the audience can recognize or relate to, such as the Hero’s Journey. Discovering tropes and how they cluster in popular works and doing it at scale to generate new plots may benefit writers; in this paper, we analyze them and use a principled procedure to identify trope combinations, or communities, that could possible be successful. The degree of development of these different communities can help us identify areas that are under-developed and, thus, susceptible to such a type of development. To detect these communities, with their associated degree of development and interest, we propose a methodology based on scientometric and complex network analysis techniques. As a secondary objective, we will obtain a general perspective in the trope and films network: the tropesphere. We have used a dataset of 10,766 movies and 25,776 tropes associated with them, together with rating, genres and popularity. Our analysis has shown that not only there are different trope communities associated with specific genres, and that there are significant differences between the rating and popularity of these communities but also there are differences on the level of development between them: emerging/declining, specific, transversal or motor.},

	abstract = {Narrative, and in particular storytelling, is an important part of the human experience. Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more eﬀective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are many factors – logical and aesthetic – that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal: (a) the logical causal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audience’s suspension of disbelief. Speciﬁcally, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents. In this article, we explore the use of reﬁnement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem – to ﬁnd a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel reﬁnement search planning algorithm –the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL) planner – that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression, reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than plans generated by conventional partial-order planners.},
